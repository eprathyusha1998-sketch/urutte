I'll try not to use too many technical terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first is the simple, effortless and result-instant path. This involves watching youtube videos with green and black thumbnails with an occasional anonymous mask on top teaching you how to download well-known tools used by thousands daily - or in other words the 'Kali Linux Copy Pasterino Skidder'. You might do something slightly amusing and gain bit of recognition and self-esteem from your friends. Your hacks will be 'real', but anybody that knows anything would dislike you as they all know all you ever did was use a few premade tools.

It is also much more fun, if you find the right people to do it with. It involves learning everything from memory interaction with machine code to high level networking - all while you're trying to break into something. This is where Capture the Flag, or 'CTF' hacking comes into play, where you compete with other individuals/teams with the goal of exploiting a service for a string of text (the flag), which is then submitted for a set amount of points. It is essentially competitive hacking. Through CTF you learn literally everything there is about the digital world, in a rather intense but exciting way. Almost all the creators/finders of major exploits have dabbled in CTF in some way/form, and almost all of them have helped solve real-world issues. However, it does take a lot of work though, as CTF becomes much more difficult as you progress through harder challenges. Some require mathematics to break encryption, and others require you to think like no one has before. If you are able to do well in a CTF competition, there is no doubt that you should be able to find exploits and create tools for yourself with relative ease. The CTF community is filled with smart people who can't give two shits about elitist mask wearing twitter hackers, instead they are genuine nerds that love screwing with machines. There's too much to explain, so I will post a few links below where you can begin your journey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember - this stuff is not easy if you don't know much, so google everything, question everything, and sooner or later you'll be down the rabbit hole far enough to be enjoying yourself.

33	2025-10-14 14:50:44.732578	openai	\N	Hi r/ecommerce \\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** OpenAI's new Sora app was downloaded over one million times in less than five days, even faster than ChatGPT hit the milestone despite only being available in North America and by invitation only. The app is now #1 in Photo &amp; Video on the Apple App store, but unfortunately it's only got a 2.8 star rating out of 3,500 reviews, with many users complaining about its guardrails being too restrictive.\n___\nOn Thursday, **China** issued new export restrictions on rare earth elements and minerals, adding five new elements and extra scrutiny for semiconductor users and dozens of pieces of refining technology to its control list. On Friday, Trump said he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China, as well as impose export controls on “any and all critical software” starting Nov 1st, in retaliation of China's new export restrictions. Following the news on Friday, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.6%. It also sparked a massive $18.28B cryptocurrency sell-off late Friday, which is the largest liquidation event in crypto history. On Sunday, China defended its new rare earth export controls, which began on Oct 9th, explaining that the measures are “designed to better safeguard world peace and regional stability" and called Trump's plan to impose another 100% tariff a "classic case of double standards." Beijing later said that it doesn't want a tariff war, but it's ready for one.\n___\n**Etsy** is overhauling its Insider buyer membership program, replacing its ambitious free shipping benefits with a 5% Etsy credit on purchases starting November 4th. The credits, which cap at $2,000 earned, do not expire as long as you continue paying the annual membership fee. Etsy will cover up to $6 in shipping costs on the least expensive U.S. domestic shipping option for orders over $15, with the buyer paying the difference. (Previously, Etsy covered up to $20 worth of shipping for all Insider orders.) Etsy's Chief Growth Officer said that the first version of Etsy Insiders "didn't provide scalable economics." Who could've predicted that?\n___\n**PayPal** launched Ads Manager, a new way for small businesses to earn revenue from their websites through display advertising. They are marketing it very strangely, claiming PayPal Ads Manager allows small businesses "to become their own retail media networks and generate new revenue streams" -- but in actuality PayPal is the one launching a retail media network .Small businesses are simply being given a new opportunity to display ads on their website from PayPal — instead of Amazon, Google, Taboola, Mediavine, etc. Despite the odd positinoing, I think it's reat that they're doing this because I support competition in the retail media ad space, and with PayPal's extensive transaction graph, its retail media network has the ability to spend advertiser dollars effectively with highly targeted advertisements, assuming they can get enough businesses on board as publishers to create a network effect.\n___\nLast week at **OpenAI's** annual developer conference, DevDay, the company unveiled new products, partnerships, and platform upgrades aimed at transforming ChatGPT from a single product into a full operating system for AI applications. Highlights include the release of GPT-5 Pro and the introduction of ChatGPT Apps, which let developers build interactive experiences directly inside ChatGPT conversations, such as booking travel, managing spreadsheets, or shopping online. A new ChatGPT App Store will allow developers to distribute and monetize their creations. The launch follows its previous attempts to let developers build interactive applications through its GPT Store, however, this new launch puts apps directly in ChatGPT’s responses and lets users call up third-party tools in their everyday conversations. For example, users can now say “Zillow, find me 5 bed 4 bath houses in Waynesville NC for under $1M” to call up the Zillow app.\n___\nLast week, **three major BNPL providers** entered the race to make their installment payments a native part of the agentic shopping experience. Affirm and Klarna announced that they are both supporting Google’s Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), an open-source, payment-agnostic framework designed to enable agent-led payments across platforms. The collaboration allows AI-powered agents to offer pay-over-time options within automated transactions. Splitit introduced its Agentic Commerce Partner Program, an invite-only pilot aimed at embedding installment payments directly into AI shopping agents. BNPL is officially everywhere! First on websites, then in-store, and now part of your AI chatbot conversations.\n___\n**Amazon** is launching prescription vending machines at select One Medical clinics in Los Angeles, operated by Amazon Pharmacy and stocked with commonly prescribed medications like antibiotics, inhalers, and blood pressure treatments. Effectively one more nail in the coffin for Walgreens and CVS. To use the kiosks, the patient's provider must first send a prescription to Amazon Pharmacy, which is reviewed by a human pharmacist. Patients then purchase the medication in the Amazon app and are given a QR code to scan at the kiosk to retrieve their medication. My Prediction: Amazon blows this model up and you start seeing Amazon Pharmacy kiosks at doctors offices and hospitals around the U.S. Then they start charging pharmaceutical companies to place their name brand drugs in their kiosks. And of course, let's not forget about the kiosk screen, which is ripe for display advertising while patients sit in the waiting room.\n___\n**Amazon** unveiled a new software platform called **Quick Suite**, which aims to simplify the creation of AI agents and enterprise chatbots that are capable of retrieving information, visualizing data, generating reports, and automating mundane tasks. Quick Suite lets users ask questions in natural language, analyze data, and take automated actions — accessing data from 50 enterprise platforms including Office 365, Slack, and Salesforce — all from a single interface.\n___\n**Not to be outdone…** **Google** introduced **Gemini Enterprise**, a new AI platform under Google Cloud that also lets companies build, deploy, and manage their own AI agents for workplace use. The platform allows agents to access and analyze data from Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and other internal systems through a secure chatbot interface. Launch customers include Figma, Klarna, Macquarie Bank, Gordon Food Service, and Virgin Voyages, which has deployed over 50 specialized agents. Gemini Enterprise targets large organizations, starting at $30/month/person, while Gemini Business is geared towards smaller businesses at a cost of $21/person/month.\n___\n**Last but not least in the world of AI agents this week…** **Adobe** introduced a new lineup of AI agents built specifically for B2B marketing, expanding its agentic offerings within the Adobe Experience Platform. The tools, which include Audience Agent, Journey Agent, and Data Insights Agent, analyze customer data to identify key decision-makers, automate cross-channel marketing campaigns, and generate actionable insights from buyer interactions. Adobe plans to add more specialized agents soon, such as an Account Qualification Agent to assess sales prospects and a Brand Concierge chatbot to engage first-time business customers.\n___\n**YouTube** is introducing a pilot “second chance” program, giving previously banned creators the opportunity to create a new channel. “How about my old channel with all my followers back?” Nope, not happening. New channels only and you're starting from scratch on follower count. “Can you at least notify my old subscribers that I launched a new channel?” Absolutely not, but let us direct your attention to our advertising platform where you can boost your videos to reach your desired audience that you already previously built. Over the next several weeks, eligible creators will begin to see an option to request a new channel when they log into YouTube Studio with their previously terminated channel. Why would they still be logging into their terminated channels? Anyway… YouTube's announcement conveniently left off that the move was made under political pressure after Republican Representative Jim Jordan issued multiple subpoenas to the company over its censorship practices.\n___\n**The Trade Desk** partnered with **Koddi** to let advertisers buy onsite retail media placements, including sponsored product ads, directly through its programmatic platform. Until now, The Trade Desk has only given advertisers access to offsite ads (ie: placements on websites, apps, or streaming platforms outside of a retailer's own website), but the new integration enables advertisers to buy onsite retail media (ie: ads that appear directly on a retailer's own site or app, like “Sponsored Products” or “Featured Items.”) Gopuff is the first retail partner, giving brands the ability to run full-funnel campaigns that connect awareness and conversion within a single workflow. \n___\n**PayPal** is introducing the ability for U.S. customers to earn 5% cash back on their PayPal BNPL purchases between now and the end of the year. The promotion will automatically apply to all eligible in-store and online BNPL transactions. The company is also expanding its Pay Monthly installment option for in-store use, allowing approved customers to pay over time using a virtual card. I wonder if other major BNPL firms will follow suit with cashback programs? Affirm experimented with an “Affirm Rewards” program back in 2023 / early 2024 where shoppers could earn points for using their BNPL at participating merchants, which they could then redeem for discounts or cashback on future purchases, but they discontinued the program in February 2024.\n___\n**Block** is offering merchants a 1% processing rate on Cash App payments, hoping to incentivize them to encourage their customers to pay with the app and sidestep Visa and Mastercard networks, which typically charge around 3%. The company is also launching “Neighborhoods,” a rewards platform that lets local businesses offer loyalty programs managed through Cash App and boost engagement among its 57M users.  Block will subsidize part of the rewards, which shoppers can view and redeem on Square terminals and through the app, encouraging them to pay with Cash App balances instead of credit cards. The initiative aims to help small businesses compete with large chains while driving more transaction volume and engagement across Block’s Cash App network.\n___\n**In other Block news… Square** launched several new features for merchants including including AI-powered voice ordering for restaurants, enhanced Square AI assistants with local insights, and an integrated Bitcoin payment solution. Restaurants and cafes can now use AI to handle phone orders and menu questions, while new tools like Grubhub integration, AI inventory management, and a redesigned kiosk interface streamline operations. Square’s updated AI assistant can generate and save dashboard widgets, recall conversation history, and display local data like weather and events. The company also introduced a Square Bitcoin wallet, allowing merchants to accept, hold, buy, and sell Bitcoin directly from their POS systems, currently with no processing fees for the first year before a 1% fee takes effect in 2027.\n___\n**Instacart** launched a **ChatGPT plugin** that lets users turn recipe ideas and meal questions into shoppable grocery lists, with ingredients deliverable in as fast as an hour. The integration combines ChatGPT’s conversational abilities with Instacart’s product catalog of over 1.5M items across 1,100 retailers, allowing users to create instant orders from natural-language prompts like “What can I make for dinner?” or “How to make spicy ass tacos!” The plugin is initially rolling out to ChatGPT Plus users, with plans to expand to all users in the coming weeks.\n___\n**In other Instacart news…** The company announced a new integration with **TikTok** that enables consumer packaged goods advertisers to use TikTok Ads Manager to tap into Instacart's first-party retail media data, which they can then use for campaign targeting and performance measurement. Instacart’s retail media network integration with TikTok will give advertisers access to audience insights for targeting high-intent shoppers, grocery data to power shoppable TikTok ads that link directly to Instacart product pages, and conversion metrics to measure and optimize campaign performance. The integration makes Instacart the first retail media partner to enable targeting and closed-loop measurement directly within TikTok Ads Manager.\n___\n**commercetools** introduced Cora, an AI shopping assistant that maintains continuity across web, mobile, and messaging channels so shoppers can pick up where they left off without losing cart data or chat history. Early features include AI-powered product discovery, cross-device continuity, and brand-controlled design, with future updates to include autonomous shopping and checkout, building on commercetools’ partnerships with Stripe and OpenAI under the Agentic Commerce Protocol. Cora is one of several AI innovations commercetools will highlight in its soon-to-be-launched Innovation Studio, where businesses can “explore new ways to reimagine commerce.”\n___\n**Perplexity** has paused accepting new advertisers in order to reevaluate how ads fit into its AI search experience and Comet browser, according to the company's head of publisher partnerships, Jessica Chan. The move follows the August departure of Taz Patel, who led ad sales at the company. Perplexity first launched its ad offering last year when it began testing campaigns with Indeed, PMG, Universal McCann, and Whole Foods, which enabled brands to sponsor follow-up questions in search results. Advertising only generated $20,000 of Perplexity's $34M total revenue last year, according to Adweek.\n___\n**Amazon Echo Show owners** are reporting an increasing amount of advertisements on their smart displays. The devices previously showed ads through its Shopping Lists feature and Alexa skills, as well as played audio ads when users listened to Amazon Music. However now users are reporting that ads are even showing when viewing personal photos, and they can’t be disabled. One user even said that ads were appearing for them during commercial breaks, meaning they were effectively served double ads.  Amazon confirmed ads are part of the experience, claiming they help with content and product discovery, but declined to say whether ad frequency has increased.\n___\n**Neil Young** is pulling his music off Amazon's streaming service and urging fans to stop supporting the company. The legendary folk singer wrote on his website earlier this week, “Forget Amazon and Whole Foods,” claiming that Amazon is one of the “big corporations who have sold out America.” He continued, “We all have to give up something to save America from the Corporate Control Age it is entering.” Fight the power Neil!\n___\nLast week I reported that **OpenAI** released its Sora 2 model, capable of generating lifelike clips of real people speaking in multiple languages, which *The Verge's* Hayden Field described as “essentially an app full of deepfakes, on purpose.” Well, it didn't take long for OpenAI to backpedal on that “anything goes” policy and add more guardrails to the app. However many users feel they turned the dial *too* far because now they can't even get the app to create videos using non-copyrighted characters like Winnie the Pooh or Steamboat Willie. I don't even have access to it yet so I can't comment. Where's my invite OpenAI??\n___\n**Buffer** analyzed 11.4M TikToks from over 150,000 accounts and found that creators who post two to five times per week see about 17% more views per post compared to weekly posters, while those posting six to ten times gain 29%, and 11+ times about 34%. Median views per video hold steady at around 500, but top-performing posts rise from roughly 3,700 views at one post per week to over 14,000 when posting 11 or more. The study shows that posting more often boosts your chances of going viral, but the sweet spot for growth is keeping a steady rhythm of two to five posts a week.\n___\n**Meta's VP of Metaverse, Vishal Shah** is telling employees responsible for building its metaverse products that they should be using AI to “go 5X faster,” according to an internal message obtained by 404 Media. The message wrote, “Think 5X, not 5%,” meaning that they should be using AI to work five times more efficiently than they are currently working, not just using it to go 5% more efficiently. Has Shah used AI to code before? I'd guess not very extensively if he actually thinks it can 5X — or even 2x — your output. Yes it speeds things up, but also yes the output code still requires human review. The message added that the standard doesn't just apply to engineers, but also “PMs, designers, and partners rolling up their sleeves and building prototypes, fixing bugs, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.”\n___\n**TikTok** updated its AI-powered ad suite with new Smart+ campaign creation tools, enhanced Symphony creative features, and a GMV Max dashboard for TikTok Shop sellers. The Smart+ system now lets advertisers choose between full, partial, or manual automation while customizing targeting, budgets, and creatives. Previously, TikTok’s Smart+ relied on full automation by default, meaning advertisers had limited control over targeting, budgeting, and creative decisions, but now these changes introduce flexible automation levels so that advertisers can customize campaign settings module-by-module instead of being locked into TikTok's full automated system. (Way to listen to your advertisers, TikTok!) The updates aim to simplify campaign management, improve ad performance through generative AI, and expand attribution tracking via Google Analytics integrations.\n___\n**Speaking of ad updates…** **Meta** is updating its Marketing API to give its Advantage+ targeting system more control over ad placement and performance optimization. A new feature will allow up to 5% of ad spend to be allocated to excluded placements if Meta’s AI predicts strong results, while legacy Advantage Shopping and App Campaign APIs will be deprecated in early 2026. The changes aim to unify all campaigns under Meta’s Advantage+ framework, enabling greater automation and AI-driven ad performance testing.\n___\n**Affirm** introduced a holiday promotion in the U.S. called 0% Days, which will run from Oct 22 to 24 and give users access to thousands of 0% APR offers from major brands across fashion, fitness, home, and travel, with repayment terms of up to 24 months. The 0% APR offer comes with no late fees, hidden charges, or interest, making the total repayment equal to the original purchase price. Affirm has previously stated that they “generally earn larger merchant fees on 0% APR financing products,” but I wasn't able to find out if those fees increase even more for merchants who participate in the 0% Days event. \n___\n**Facebook** announced that it's retiring its Gaming Creator Program in 2026. The program originally launched in 2018 to give gaming creators early access to new features, more direct access to Facebook's support teams, and assistance in monetizing their channels, but now Meta is scaling back the initiative and pushing gamers into its general creator monetization program. Offering support? What was Facebook thinking at the time? Throw them to the AI chatbot for support like everyone else!\n___\n**Amazon** implemented a Final Sale policy for collectible trading cards and Funko Pop figures sold through FBA, effective October 1, 2025. The policy marks these products as non-returnable and non-refundable, except in cases of damage, and automatically applies based on product category. The change arrives ahead of Amazon’s extended holiday return window and has been met with a positive response from collectible sellers, who typically face high costs and more difficulty dealing with return fraud due to the limited nature of the products they sell.\n___\nThe **FCC** wants to make it easier for **Internet service providers** to charge hidden fees via a new proposal that weakens Biden-era transparency rules. Now why the hell would they want to go and do something like that? Those fees must add up to be big money if ISPs are willing to pay off congressmen to bring them back! The FCC submitted a proposal to revise “unnecessary” requirements for ISPs to itemize every fee on monthly bills, citing that it may “confuse customers.” Yeah, maybe simpletons like FCC chairman Brendan Carr who gets confused if there are too many words on a page. The rest of us appreciate the transparency. The proposal falls under the “Delete, Delete, Delete” initiative Carr launched in March that aims appease President Trump’s order to remove as many government regulations as possible, including the ones designed to protect consumers from unscrupulous pricing tactics and hidden fees.\n___\n**The American Apparel and Footwear Association**, which represents more than 1,100 clothing and footwear brands across the U.S., is calling on the U.S. government to designate Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, AliExpress, Taobao, and Shopee as “notorious markets” for counterfeit goods. The group accuses the platforms of enabling and profiting from counterfeit sales driven by AI-generated listings, posing risks to consumers and U.S. businesses. AAFA CEO Steve Lamar said the move would pressure platforms to strengthen anti-counterfeiting measures and raise public awareness of online counterfeit trade. Mr. Lamar, I'm confident that the public is *very* much aware…\n___\n**California Governor Gavin Newsom** signed the California Opt Me Out Act, a new law that requires all major web browsers to include a simple, visible button letting users opt out of having their personal data sold. Taking effect in January 2027, the law expands the California Consumer Privacy Act, which originally allowed consumers to opt-out of having their data sold to third parties, but major web browsers didn't make it a simple process. Whereas the new Opt Me Out Act requires that opt-out tools be easy to locate and configure. Everyone switch your VPNs to California! How messed up would it be if Google made the opt-out button say something like, “No, I don't want to enjoy browsing personalization and other helpful tools.” LOL!\n___\n**X** reached a settlement with **former Twitter executives** Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Vijaya Gadde, and Sean Edgett, who sued the company for $128M in unpaid severance following Elon Musk’s 2022 takeover. The executives alleged they were contractually owed compensation that included salaries and stock options, while Musk claimed they were terminated for misconduct. The settlement terms were not disclosed, but I really want to know! X settled a separate, but similar, lawsuit in August from lower-level employees who were dismissed after Musk took over, who argued they were owed $500M in unpaid severance. The terms of that settlement were also not disclosed. Anyone want to break their NDA?\n___\n**Salesforce** confirmed it will not negotiate with or pay ransom demands from the hacking group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which claims to have stolen nearly 1B records from Salesforce customers. The group launched a data leak site targeting 39 companies including Google, FedEx, Disney, Marriott, and McDonald’s, but the site has since been taken offline, possibly by U.S. authorities. The breaches stem from two major 2025 campaigns involving malicious OAuth apps and stolen SalesLoft Drift tokens, impacting hundreds of corporate CRM environments. Salesforce says it will not pay extortion demands despite threats to leak the stolen data. Are Salesforce's clients onboard with that decision? \n___\n**This week in corporate shakeups…**\n\n* **Shopify** promoted Jess Hertz to COO, following Kaz Nejatian's departure from the company last month to become CEO of Opendoor, and elevated Jean Niehaus to succeed fellow former Facebook lawyer Jessica Hertz as general counsel for the company. Also at Shopify, CRO Bobby Morrison is stepping down from his role.\n* **Verizon** appointed former PayPal CEO and longtime board member Dan Schulman as its CEO, replacing Hans Gruber Vestberg who took the position in 2018.\n* **Meta** poached Thinking Machines Lab co-founder Andrew Tulloch to join its Superintelligence Team. A spokesperson for the company said that Tulloch “has decided to pursue a different path for personal reasons.” LOL, money.\n* **POWR**, the website and app building platform, named Kyle Bennett CEO, who most recently served as CEO at Fluorescent Design Inc.\n___\n**In Europe this week…**  A new law in the EU called **Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising** kicked in on Friday, bringing new restrictions and transparency requirements for paid political ads. Since the law was agreed, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have all opted out of showing political ads in the EU altogether. (That's why you have to click that box now every time you create a new campaign!) Slovak EU lawmaker Veronika Cifrová Ostrihoňová argues that the platforms are taking the “easier route,” which she says is a “worrying signal” of tech firms refusing to seek compromises with rule makers. Google says the definition of political advertising is too broad (so ask for clarification), and Meta criticized targeted ad restrictions that ignore the “benefits to advertisers and the people they want to reach.” Man those guys really hate dealing with European regulation!\n___\n**Remember the Canada Post strike?** No, not that one. The other one. LOL, feels like Canada Post is always on strike, especially around the holidays. Well on Sep 25th, the Canadian Union of Postal workers declared a countrywide strike hours after the government announced changes to the postal service, including expanding use of community mailboxes, closing rural post offices, reducing delivery frequency, and ending door-to-door mail delivery for nearly all Canadian households within the next decade. On Saturday, the union shifted to a rotating strike system, ending more than two weeks of mail delivery blackouts. The union says that its battle continues, but the rotating strike allows workers to resume their jobs while simultaneously reminding Canadians that a full postal service is worth fighting for.\n___\n**Super money**, a fintech spun off by Flipkart last year, partnered with payments infrastructure firm **Juspay** to launch its new D2C checkout product, Super money Breeze, as it targets $100M in annual revenue by 2026. The partnership comes as Juspay seeks to recover from merchant losses and stalled fundraising following disputes with payment gateways earlier this year. Super money, which is now one of India’s top five UPI apps, processes over 200M monthly transactions and has issued more than 300k secured credit cards. The collaboration positions Super money to expand beyond Flipkart’s ecosystem while giving Juspay an opportunity to rebuild trust among merchants.\n___\n**Speaking of Indian commerce…** **India’s National Payments Corporation** partnered with **OpenAI** and **Razorpay** to pilot a new program allowing consumers to shop and pay directly through ChatGPT using UPI Reserve Pay and UPI Circle. The system lets users complete purchases within chatbots without leaving the conversation, with BigBasket and Vi as launch partners and banks including Axis Bank and Airtel Payments Bank powering transactions. Razorpay has also completed proofs-of-concept with Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, which are expected to go live soon. The pilot marks India’s first move toward agentic commerce, embedding UPI payments into conversational AI experiences.\n___\n**Amazon** opened a new delivery station, known as DII5, in Elkhart, Indiana, built primarily from mass timber, to serve as a test bed for more than 40 sustainability initiatives, including low-carbon concrete, air-source heat pumps, and a rainwater reclamation system. The project is part of Amazon's Climate Pledge to decarbonize operations by 2040 and aims to accelerate adoption of sustainable materials like mass timber across its global logistics network. Lessons that Amazon learns from this warehouse will inform future building projects. Now that's the kind of Amazon news I can get behind!\n___\n**Axe body spray** released a limited edition can designed in collaboration with graphic designer Emily Zugay featuring a completely white can with a lone graphic of an axe — like the kind you chop wood with. The collaboration began with a TikTok post Zugay made in July where she jokingly (or seriously? I can't tell with her) redesigned various company logos. The video went viral, received over 5M views and 500k likes, and caught Unilever's attention, which jumped at the opportunity to capitalize on the attention with its limited edition can. So now you know how many views / likes it takes to get a limited edition product made.\n___\n**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** You can now buy a humanoid robot from Walmart! Well, you *could*. They must've either sold out or Walmart became concerned over the attention the listing was getting because it's no longer active. However last week, Walmart's U.S. website was selling the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for $21,600 with free shipping and a six-unit purchase limit. Even though it's no longer available for sale on Walmart, you can still purchase one on the company's website for around $16k. \n___\nPlus 14 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including Apple being in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from Prompt AI and acquire the company's tech.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.

By pure chance, I was able to try the Sony 200-600mm a couple of nights ago. My intention was to make a few tests, to shoot Andromeda, Orion, and the Pleiades just to see how they look at 600mm, and I thought of giving the comet a try. I was shocked when I saw it on the camera, and after a while of trial and error, I was able to stack 23 shots—not much more than one hour of integration. For me, it’s the first time I’ve shot and finished a photo at this focal length, and this comet was a great experience to start with.\n\n@ igneis.nightscapes\n\nEXIF\n\nSony a7 III Astro mod \n\nSony 200-600mm f5.6/6.3 G\n\nZWO AM5N \n\n23 shots, 220s, ISO 1.600, f/6.3	I captured the comet Lemmon with my mirrorless camera	https://i.redd.it/zt9b9r43wruf1.jpeg	active	2025-10-14 14:51:00.293045	1	37	9

44	2025-10-14 14:51:20.159068	openai	\N	Hello all, I am early career peds subspecialty in an underserved area. I have never been angry at patients until today. For background, I work in an academic medical center. My no show rate is atrocious - easily 60-70%. This is refractory to overbooking and patient calls (families confirm they will be here the day before then suddenly change their plans). We can't charge no show fees (enforcing a policy for the 5% with private insurance isn't worth it). Discharging repeat offenders is a possibility, but I hate to punish the kids for the parents' issue. Clinical admin is supportive and wants to give this time. I make myself available to community providers to increase referral base.\n\nI normally love my job and find other stuff to do, but today my kids are out of school and I'm stuck in the clinic. What's worse is that the other clinics are busy; it's just me waiting for the chance to help people. I feel like I'm sacrificing my family for people who don't show up. \n\nI'd rather quit and do urgent care or locums if this keeps up. What's worse though is my contract's non compete is a 50 mile radius, but the wording would let me practice gen peds.\n\nHas anyone else solved this kind of problem?\n-------\nUpdate:\nThank you for all this support and useful suggestions! I don't have the energy to reply to everyone personally. Here are my responses to replies: \n\n"Set boundaries, you spineless fish! Patients need late fees and negative incentives to know how to treat you!" These responses made me the happiest! Is there a fancy psychology term for "escapist fantasy that helps you when you are sleep deprived, miss your kids, and feel like a piece of junk"?\n\n"Figure out why your patients are no showing before being a grump!" I actually have been doing a QI on this for the past 7 months. There is little identifiable rhyme or reason why people no show. Return pts no show ~40% and new pts no show ~60% (the original post was hyperbolic, my actual no show rate is 54%). There is no significant difference between NP and MD/DO referrals. Self referrals have better no show rates. The urgent referrals (e.g., PCP calls the link line or texts my cell) have an appointment offered within 1 week and they still have high no show rates!\n\n"Your patients are no showing for reasons, why don't you try empathy before judgement!" We already reach out to see how we can help, by phone, email, and Doximity text. We connect pts with transportation resources through their insurance. I offer telemed when appropriate. We have multiple off site locations to reduce barriers. ICE raids are largely a non issue in my community.\n\n"Dude, stop complaining about no-shows and take the free paycheck!" I normally find other ways to be productive. However today's free paycheck actually cost me time with my family. If something keeps you from your loved ones you would be angry too.  \n\n"That sucks, but this is what you signed up for." Thank you for commiserating. This is not what I signed up for; I signed up to help underserved people with rare disease. Congratulations to me, I lasted a whole 11 months as an attending before burnout. \n\nMany people offered actionable suggestions. Some have been tried and didn't help. Some were alternate ways of implementing ideas - I'll try some of those.

45	2025-10-14 14:51:20.168529	openai	\N	Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has issued a letter to Houston Methodist Hospital regarding allegations that the hospital conditioned organ transplant eligibility on vaccination status.\n\nAccording to Paxton’s office:\n\n&gt; “The letter directs Houston Methodist to clarify whether its policies comply with state law prohibiting discrimination against organ transplant patients based on vaccination status. This action comes amid reports that the hospital may have previously conditioned access to life-saving procedures, such as kidney transplants, on patients getting the COVID-19 vaccine.”\n\nHe cites House Bill 4076 (2025), now part of the Texas Health &amp; Safety Code §161.474, which bars healthcare providers from denying, delaying, or prioritizing transplant services based on "solely" vaccination status. \n\nThese bills are medically nonsensical but they still lead to harassment from government, create confusion among clinicians, and divert hospital resources away from actually useful patient care.  Reminds me of the pregnant patient advance directives bills. \n\nPress release from Texas Attorney General’s Office: \nhttps://texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-warns-houston-methodist-hospital-over-alleged-covid-19-vaccine-mandates\n\nText of HB 4076 "AN ACT\trelating to prohibiting organ transplant recipient discrimination\ton the basis of vaccination status." https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB4076/id/3244948	Texas AG warns Houston Methodist over alleged vaccine-based transplant restrictions	https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1o5x4wf/texas_ag_warns_houston_methodist_over_alleged/	active	2025-10-14 14:51:20.168536	1	45	11

31	2025-10-14 14:50:43.155939	openai	\N	Hi r/ecommerce \\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** OpenAI's new Sora app was downloaded over one million times in less than five days, even faster than ChatGPT hit the milestone despite only being available in North America and by invitation only. The app is now #1 in Photo &amp; Video on the Apple App store, but unfortunately it's only got a 2.8 star rating out of 3,500 reviews, with many users complaining about its guardrails being too restrictive.\n___\nOn Thursday, **China** issued new export restrictions on rare earth elements and minerals, adding five new elements and extra scrutiny for semiconductor users and dozens of pieces of refining technology to its control list. On Friday, Trump said he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China, as well as impose export controls on “any and all critical software” starting Nov 1st, in retaliation of China's new export restrictions. Following the news on Friday, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.6%. It also sparked a massive $18.28B cryptocurrency sell-off late Friday, which is the largest liquidation event in crypto history. On Sunday, China defended its new rare earth export controls, which began on Oct 9th, explaining that the measures are “designed to better safeguard world peace and regional stability" and called Trump's plan to impose another 100% tariff a "classic case of double standards." Beijing later said that it doesn't want a tariff war, but it's ready for one.\n___\n**Etsy** is overhauling its Insider buyer membership program, replacing its ambitious free shipping benefits with a 5% Etsy credit on purchases starting November 4th. The credits, which cap at $2,000 earned, do not expire as long as you continue paying the annual membership fee. Etsy will cover up to $6 in shipping costs on the least expensive U.S. domestic shipping option for orders over $15, with the buyer paying the difference. (Previously, Etsy covered up to $20 worth of shipping for all Insider orders.) Etsy's Chief Growth Officer said that the first version of Etsy Insiders "didn't provide scalable economics." Who could've predicted that?\n___\n**PayPal** launched Ads Manager, a new way for small businesses to earn revenue from their websites through display advertising. They are marketing it very strangely, claiming PayPal Ads Manager allows small businesses "to become their own retail media networks and generate new revenue streams" -- but in actuality PayPal is the one launching a retail media network .Small businesses are simply being given a new opportunity to display ads on their website from PayPal — instead of Amazon, Google, Taboola, Mediavine, etc. Despite the odd positinoing, I think it's reat that they're doing this because I support competition in the retail media ad space, and with PayPal's extensive transaction graph, its retail media network has the ability to spend advertiser dollars effectively with highly targeted advertisements, assuming they can get enough businesses on board as publishers to create a network effect.\n___\nLast week at **OpenAI's** annual developer conference, DevDay, the company unveiled new products, partnerships, and platform upgrades aimed at transforming ChatGPT from a single product into a full operating system for AI applications. Highlights include the release of GPT-5 Pro and the introduction of ChatGPT Apps, which let developers build interactive experiences directly inside ChatGPT conversations, such as booking travel, managing spreadsheets, or shopping online. A new ChatGPT App Store will allow developers to distribute and monetize their creations. The launch follows its previous attempts to let developers build interactive applications through its GPT Store, however, this new launch puts apps directly in ChatGPT’s responses and lets users call up third-party tools in their everyday conversations. For example, users can now say “Zillow, find me 5 bed 4 bath houses in Waynesville NC for under $1M” to call up the Zillow app.\n___\nLast week, **three major BNPL providers** entered the race to make their installment payments a native part of the agentic shopping experience. Affirm and Klarna announced that they are both supporting Google’s Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), an open-source, payment-agnostic framework designed to enable agent-led payments across platforms. The collaboration allows AI-powered agents to offer pay-over-time options within automated transactions. Splitit introduced its Agentic Commerce Partner Program, an invite-only pilot aimed at embedding installment payments directly into AI shopping agents. BNPL is officially everywhere! First on websites, then in-store, and now part of your AI chatbot conversations.\n___\n**Amazon** is launching prescription vending machines at select One Medical clinics in Los Angeles, operated by Amazon Pharmacy and stocked with commonly prescribed medications like antibiotics, inhalers, and blood pressure treatments. Effectively one more nail in the coffin for Walgreens and CVS. To use the kiosks, the patient's provider must first send a prescription to Amazon Pharmacy, which is reviewed by a human pharmacist. Patients then purchase the medication in the Amazon app and are given a QR code to scan at the kiosk to retrieve their medication. My Prediction: Amazon blows this model up and you start seeing Amazon Pharmacy kiosks at doctors offices and hospitals around the U.S. Then they start charging pharmaceutical companies to place their name brand drugs in their kiosks. And of course, let's not forget about the kiosk screen, which is ripe for display advertising while patients sit in the waiting room.\n___\n**Amazon** unveiled a new software platform called **Quick Suite**, which aims to simplify the creation of AI agents and enterprise chatbots that are capable of retrieving information, visualizing data, generating reports, and automating mundane tasks. Quick Suite lets users ask questions in natural language, analyze data, and take automated actions — accessing data from 50 enterprise platforms including Office 365, Slack, and Salesforce — all from a single interface.\n___\n**Not to be outdone…** **Google** introduced **Gemini Enterprise**, a new AI platform under Google Cloud that also lets companies build, deploy, and manage their own AI agents for workplace use. The platform allows agents to access and analyze data from Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and other internal systems through a secure chatbot interface. Launch customers include Figma, Klarna, Macquarie Bank, Gordon Food Service, and Virgin Voyages, which has deployed over 50 specialized agents. Gemini Enterprise targets large organizations, starting at $30/month/person, while Gemini Business is geared towards smaller businesses at a cost of $21/person/month.\n___\n**Last but not least in the world of AI agents this week…** **Adobe** introduced a new lineup of AI agents built specifically for B2B marketing, expanding its agentic offerings within the Adobe Experience Platform. The tools, which include Audience Agent, Journey Agent, and Data Insights Agent, analyze customer data to identify key decision-makers, automate cross-channel marketing campaigns, and generate actionable insights from buyer interactions. Adobe plans to add more specialized agents soon, such as an Account Qualification Agent to assess sales prospects and a Brand Concierge chatbot to engage first-time business customers.\n___\n**YouTube** is introducing a pilot “second chance” program, giving previously banned creators the opportunity to create a new channel. “How about my old channel with all my followers back?” Nope, not happening. New channels only and you're starting from scratch on follower count. “Can you at least notify my old subscribers that I launched a new channel?” Absolutely not, but let us direct your attention to our advertising platform where you can boost your videos to reach your desired audience that you already previously built. Over the next several weeks, eligible creators will begin to see an option to request a new channel when they log into YouTube Studio with their previously terminated channel. Why would they still be logging into their terminated channels? Anyway… YouTube's announcement conveniently left off that the move was made under political pressure after Republican Representative Jim Jordan issued multiple subpoenas to the company over its censorship practices.\n___\n**The Trade Desk** partnered with **Koddi** to let advertisers buy onsite retail media placements, including sponsored product ads, directly through its programmatic platform. Until now, The Trade Desk has only given advertisers access to offsite ads (ie: placements on websites, apps, or streaming platforms outside of a retailer's own website), but the new integration enables advertisers to buy onsite retail media (ie: ads that appear directly on a retailer's own site or app, like “Sponsored Products” or “Featured Items.”) Gopuff is the first retail partner, giving brands the ability to run full-funnel campaigns that connect awareness and conversion within a single workflow. \n___\n**PayPal** is introducing the ability for U.S. customers to earn 5% cash back on their PayPal BNPL purchases between now and the end of the year. The promotion will automatically apply to all eligible in-store and online BNPL transactions. The company is also expanding its Pay Monthly installment option for in-store use, allowing approved customers to pay over time using a virtual card. I wonder if other major BNPL firms will follow suit with cashback programs? Affirm experimented with an “Affirm Rewards” program back in 2023 / early 2024 where shoppers could earn points for using their BNPL at participating merchants, which they could then redeem for discounts or cashback on future purchases, but they discontinued the program in February 2024.\n___\n**Block** is offering merchants a 1% processing rate on Cash App payments, hoping to incentivize them to encourage their customers to pay with the app and sidestep Visa and Mastercard networks, which typically charge around 3%. The company is also launching “Neighborhoods,” a rewards platform that lets local businesses offer loyalty programs managed through Cash App and boost engagement among its 57M users.  Block will subsidize part of the rewards, which shoppers can view and redeem on Square terminals and through the app, encouraging them to pay with Cash App balances instead of credit cards. The initiative aims to help small businesses compete with large chains while driving more transaction volume and engagement across Block’s Cash App network.\n___\n**In other Block news… Square** launched several new features for merchants including including AI-powered voice ordering for restaurants, enhanced Square AI assistants with local insights, and an integrated Bitcoin payment solution. Restaurants and cafes can now use AI to handle phone orders and menu questions, while new tools like Grubhub integration, AI inventory management, and a redesigned kiosk interface streamline operations. Square’s updated AI assistant can generate and save dashboard widgets, recall conversation history, and display local data like weather and events. The company also introduced a Square Bitcoin wallet, allowing merchants to accept, hold, buy, and sell Bitcoin directly from their POS systems, currently with no processing fees for the first year before a 1% fee takes effect in 2027.\n___\n**Instacart** launched a **ChatGPT plugin** that lets users turn recipe ideas and meal questions into shoppable grocery lists, with ingredients deliverable in as fast as an hour. The integration combines ChatGPT’s conversational abilities with Instacart’s product catalog of over 1.5M items across 1,100 retailers, allowing users to create instant orders from natural-language prompts like “What can I make for dinner?” or “How to make spicy ass tacos!” The plugin is initially rolling out to ChatGPT Plus users, with plans to expand to all users in the coming weeks.\n___\n**In other Instacart news…** The company announced a new integration with **TikTok** that enables consumer packaged goods advertisers to use TikTok Ads Manager to tap into Instacart's first-party retail media data, which they can then use for campaign targeting and performance measurement. Instacart’s retail media network integration with TikTok will give advertisers access to audience insights for targeting high-intent shoppers, grocery data to power shoppable TikTok ads that link directly to Instacart product pages, and conversion metrics to measure and optimize campaign performance. The integration makes Instacart the first retail media partner to enable targeting and closed-loop measurement directly within TikTok Ads Manager.\n___\n**commercetools** introduced Cora, an AI shopping assistant that maintains continuity across web, mobile, and messaging channels so shoppers can pick up where they left off without losing cart data or chat history. Early features include AI-powered product discovery, cross-device continuity, and brand-controlled design, with future updates to include autonomous shopping and checkout, building on commercetools’ partnerships with Stripe and OpenAI under the Agentic Commerce Protocol. Cora is one of several AI innovations commercetools will highlight in its soon-to-be-launched Innovation Studio, where businesses can “explore new ways to reimagine commerce.”\n___\n**Perplexity** has paused accepting new advertisers in order to reevaluate how ads fit into its AI search experience and Comet browser, according to the company's head of publisher partnerships, Jessica Chan. The move follows the August departure of Taz Patel, who led ad sales at the company. Perplexity first launched its ad offering last year when it began testing campaigns with Indeed, PMG, Universal McCann, and Whole Foods, which enabled brands to sponsor follow-up questions in search results. Advertising only generated $20,000 of Perplexity's $34M total revenue last year, according to Adweek.\n___\n**Amazon Echo Show owners** are reporting an increasing amount of advertisements on their smart displays. The devices previously showed ads through its Shopping Lists feature and Alexa skills, as well as played audio ads when users listened to Amazon Music. However now users are reporting that ads are even showing when viewing personal photos, and they can’t be disabled. One user even said that ads were appearing for them during commercial breaks, meaning they were effectively served double ads.  Amazon confirmed ads are part of the experience, claiming they help with content and product discovery, but declined to say whether ad frequency has increased.\n___\n**Neil Young** is pulling his music off Amazon's streaming service and urging fans to stop supporting the company. The legendary folk singer wrote on his website earlier this week, “Forget Amazon and Whole Foods,” claiming that Amazon is one of the “big corporations who have sold out America.” He continued, “We all have to give up something to save America from the Corporate Control Age it is entering.” Fight the power Neil!\n___\nLast week I reported that **OpenAI** released its Sora 2 model, capable of generating lifelike clips of real people speaking in multiple languages, which *The Verge's* Hayden Field described as “essentially an app full of deepfakes, on purpose.” Well, it didn't take long for OpenAI to backpedal on that “anything goes” policy and add more guardrails to the app. However many users feel they turned the dial *too* far because now they can't even get the app to create videos using non-copyrighted characters like Winnie the Pooh or Steamboat Willie. I don't even have access to it yet so I can't comment. Where's my invite OpenAI??\n___\n**Buffer** analyzed 11.4M TikToks from over 150,000 accounts and found that creators who post two to five times per week see about 17% more views per post compared to weekly posters, while those posting six to ten times gain 29%, and 11+ times about 34%. Median views per video hold steady at around 500, but top-performing posts rise from roughly 3,700 views at one post per week to over 14,000 when posting 11 or more. The study shows that posting more often boosts your chances of going viral, but the sweet spot for growth is keeping a steady rhythm of two to five posts a week.\n___\n**Meta's VP of Metaverse, Vishal Shah** is telling employees responsible for building its metaverse products that they should be using AI to “go 5X faster,” according to an internal message obtained by 404 Media. The message wrote, “Think 5X, not 5%,” meaning that they should be using AI to work five times more efficiently than they are currently working, not just using it to go 5% more efficiently. Has Shah used AI to code before? I'd guess not very extensively if he actually thinks it can 5X — or even 2x — your output. Yes it speeds things up, but also yes the output code still requires human review. The message added that the standard doesn't just apply to engineers, but also “PMs, designers, and partners rolling up their sleeves and building prototypes, fixing bugs, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.”\n___\n**TikTok** updated its AI-powered ad suite with new Smart+ campaign creation tools, enhanced Symphony creative features, and a GMV Max dashboard for TikTok Shop sellers. The Smart+ system now lets advertisers choose between full, partial, or manual automation while customizing targeting, budgets, and creatives. Previously, TikTok’s Smart+ relied on full automation by default, meaning advertisers had limited control over targeting, budgeting, and creative decisions, but now these changes introduce flexible automation levels so that advertisers can customize campaign settings module-by-module instead of being locked into TikTok's full automated system. (Way to listen to your advertisers, TikTok!) The updates aim to simplify campaign management, improve ad performance through generative AI, and expand attribution tracking via Google Analytics integrations.\n___\n**Speaking of ad updates…** **Meta** is updating its Marketing API to give its Advantage+ targeting system more control over ad placement and performance optimization. A new feature will allow up to 5% of ad spend to be allocated to excluded placements if Meta’s AI predicts strong results, while legacy Advantage Shopping and App Campaign APIs will be deprecated in early 2026. The changes aim to unify all campaigns under Meta’s Advantage+ framework, enabling greater automation and AI-driven ad performance testing.\n___\n**Affirm** introduced a holiday promotion in the U.S. called 0% Days, which will run from Oct 22 to 24 and give users access to thousands of 0% APR offers from major brands across fashion, fitness, home, and travel, with repayment terms of up to 24 months. The 0% APR offer comes with no late fees, hidden charges, or interest, making the total repayment equal to the original purchase price. Affirm has previously stated that they “generally earn larger merchant fees on 0% APR financing products,” but I wasn't able to find out if those fees increase even more for merchants who participate in the 0% Days event. \n___\n**Facebook** announced that it's retiring its Gaming Creator Program in 2026. The program originally launched in 2018 to give gaming creators early access to new features, more direct access to Facebook's support teams, and assistance in monetizing their channels, but now Meta is scaling back the initiative and pushing gamers into its general creator monetization program. Offering support? What was Facebook thinking at the time? Throw them to the AI chatbot for support like everyone else!\n___\n**Amazon** implemented a Final Sale policy for collectible trading cards and Funko Pop figures sold through FBA, effective October 1, 2025. The policy marks these products as non-returnable and non-refundable, except in cases of damage, and automatically applies based on product category. The change arrives ahead of Amazon’s extended holiday return window and has been met with a positive response from collectible sellers, who typically face high costs and more difficulty dealing with return fraud due to the limited nature of the products they sell.\n___\nThe **FCC** wants to make it easier for **Internet service providers** to charge hidden fees via a new proposal that weakens Biden-era transparency rules. Now why the hell would they want to go and do something like that? Those fees must add up to be big money if ISPs are willing to pay off congressmen to bring them back! The FCC submitted a proposal to revise “unnecessary” requirements for ISPs to itemize every fee on monthly bills, citing that it may “confuse customers.” Yeah, maybe simpletons like FCC chairman Brendan Carr who gets confused if there are too many words on a page. The rest of us appreciate the transparency. The proposal falls under the “Delete, Delete, Delete” initiative Carr launched in March that aims appease President Trump’s order to remove as many government regulations as possible, including the ones designed to protect consumers from unscrupulous pricing tactics and hidden fees.\n___\n**The American Apparel and Footwear Association**, which represents more than 1,100 clothing and footwear brands across the U.S., is calling on the U.S. government to designate Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, AliExpress, Taobao, and Shopee as “notorious markets” for counterfeit goods. The group accuses the platforms of enabling and profiting from counterfeit sales driven by AI-generated listings, posing risks to consumers and U.S. businesses. AAFA CEO Steve Lamar said the move would pressure platforms to strengthen anti-counterfeiting measures and raise public awareness of online counterfeit trade. Mr. Lamar, I'm confident that the public is *very* much aware…\n___\n**California Governor Gavin Newsom** signed the California Opt Me Out Act, a new law that requires all major web browsers to include a simple, visible button letting users opt out of having their personal data sold. Taking effect in January 2027, the law expands the California Consumer Privacy Act, which originally allowed consumers to opt-out of having their data sold to third parties, but major web browsers didn't make it a simple process. Whereas the new Opt Me Out Act requires that opt-out tools be easy to locate and configure. Everyone switch your VPNs to California! How messed up would it be if Google made the opt-out button say something like, “No, I don't want to enjoy browsing personalization and other helpful tools.” LOL!\n___\n**X** reached a settlement with **former Twitter executives** Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Vijaya Gadde, and Sean Edgett, who sued the company for $128M in unpaid severance following Elon Musk’s 2022 takeover. The executives alleged they were contractually owed compensation that included salaries and stock options, while Musk claimed they were terminated for misconduct. The settlement terms were not disclosed, but I really want to know! X settled a separate, but similar, lawsuit in August from lower-level employees who were dismissed after Musk took over, who argued they were owed $500M in unpaid severance. The terms of that settlement were also not disclosed. Anyone want to break their NDA?\n___\n**Salesforce** confirmed it will not negotiate with or pay ransom demands from the hacking group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which claims to have stolen nearly 1B records from Salesforce customers. The group launched a data leak site targeting 39 companies including Google, FedEx, Disney, Marriott, and McDonald’s, but the site has since been taken offline, possibly by U.S. authorities. The breaches stem from two major 2025 campaigns involving malicious OAuth apps and stolen SalesLoft Drift tokens, impacting hundreds of corporate CRM environments. Salesforce says it will not pay extortion demands despite threats to leak the stolen data. Are Salesforce's clients onboard with that decision? \n___\n**This week in corporate shakeups…**\n\n* **Shopify** promoted Jess Hertz to COO, following Kaz Nejatian's departure from the company last month to become CEO of Opendoor, and elevated Jean Niehaus to succeed fellow former Facebook lawyer Jessica Hertz as general counsel for the company. Also at Shopify, CRO Bobby Morrison is stepping down from his role.\n* **Verizon** appointed former PayPal CEO and longtime board member Dan Schulman as its CEO, replacing Hans Gruber Vestberg who took the position in 2018.\n* **Meta** poached Thinking Machines Lab co-founder Andrew Tulloch to join its Superintelligence Team. A spokesperson for the company said that Tulloch “has decided to pursue a different path for personal reasons.” LOL, money.\n* **POWR**, the website and app building platform, named Kyle Bennett CEO, who most recently served as CEO at Fluorescent Design Inc.\n___\n**In Europe this week…**  A new law in the EU called **Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising** kicked in on Friday, bringing new restrictions and transparency requirements for paid political ads. Since the law was agreed, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have all opted out of showing political ads in the EU altogether. (That's why you have to click that box now every time you create a new campaign!) Slovak EU lawmaker Veronika Cifrová Ostrihoňová argues that the platforms are taking the “easier route,” which she says is a “worrying signal” of tech firms refusing to seek compromises with rule makers. Google says the definition of political advertising is too broad (so ask for clarification), and Meta criticized targeted ad restrictions that ignore the “benefits to advertisers and the people they want to reach.” Man those guys really hate dealing with European regulation!\n___\n**Remember the Canada Post strike?** No, not that one. The other one. LOL, feels like Canada Post is always on strike, especially around the holidays. Well on Sep 25th, the Canadian Union of Postal workers declared a countrywide strike hours after the government announced changes to the postal service, including expanding use of community mailboxes, closing rural post offices, reducing delivery frequency, and ending door-to-door mail delivery for nearly all Canadian households within the next decade. On Saturday, the union shifted to a rotating strike system, ending more than two weeks of mail delivery blackouts. The union says that its battle continues, but the rotating strike allows workers to resume their jobs while simultaneously reminding Canadians that a full postal service is worth fighting for.\n___\n**Super money**, a fintech spun off by Flipkart last year, partnered with payments infrastructure firm **Juspay** to launch its new D2C checkout product, Super money Breeze, as it targets $100M in annual revenue by 2026. The partnership comes as Juspay seeks to recover from merchant losses and stalled fundraising following disputes with payment gateways earlier this year. Super money, which is now one of India’s top five UPI apps, processes over 200M monthly transactions and has issued more than 300k secured credit cards. The collaboration positions Super money to expand beyond Flipkart’s ecosystem while giving Juspay an opportunity to rebuild trust among merchants.\n___\n**Speaking of Indian commerce…** **India’s National Payments Corporation** partnered with **OpenAI** and **Razorpay** to pilot a new program allowing consumers to shop and pay directly through ChatGPT using UPI Reserve Pay and UPI Circle. The system lets users complete purchases within chatbots without leaving the conversation, with BigBasket and Vi as launch partners and banks including Axis Bank and Airtel Payments Bank powering transactions. Razorpay has also completed proofs-of-concept with Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, which are expected to go live soon. The pilot marks India’s first move toward agentic commerce, embedding UPI payments into conversational AI experiences.\n___\n**Amazon** opened a new delivery station, known as DII5, in Elkhart, Indiana, built primarily from mass timber, to serve as a test bed for more than 40 sustainability initiatives, including low-carbon concrete, air-source heat pumps, and a rainwater reclamation system. The project is part of Amazon's Climate Pledge to decarbonize operations by 2040 and aims to accelerate adoption of sustainable materials like mass timber across its global logistics network. Lessons that Amazon learns from this warehouse will inform future building projects. Now that's the kind of Amazon news I can get behind!\n___\n**Axe body spray** released a limited edition can designed in collaboration with graphic designer Emily Zugay featuring a completely white can with a lone graphic of an axe — like the kind you chop wood with. The collaboration began with a TikTok post Zugay made in July where she jokingly (or seriously? I can't tell with her) redesigned various company logos. The video went viral, received over 5M views and 500k likes, and caught Unilever's attention, which jumped at the opportunity to capitalize on the attention with its limited edition can. So now you know how many views / likes it takes to get a limited edition product made.\n___\n**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** You can now buy a humanoid robot from Walmart! Well, you *could*. They must've either sold out or Walmart became concerned over the attention the listing was getting because it's no longer active. However last week, Walmart's U.S. website was selling the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for $21,600 with free shipping and a six-unit purchase limit. Even though it's no longer available for sale on Walmart, you can still purchase one on the company's website for around $16k. \n___\nPlus 14 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including Apple being in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from Prompt AI and acquire the company's tech.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.

By pure chance, I was able to try the Sony 200-600mm a couple of nights ago. My intention was to make a few tests, to shoot Andromeda, Orion, and the Pleiades just to see how they look at 600mm, and I thought of giving the comet a try. I was shocked when I saw it on the camera, and after a while of trial and error, I was able to stack 23 shots—not much more than one hour of integration.

41	2025-10-14 14:51:19.537069	openai	\N	Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has issued a letter to Houston Methodist Hospital regarding allegations that the hospital conditioned organ transplant eligibility on vaccination status.\n\nAccording to Paxton’s office:\n\n&gt; “The letter directs Houston Methodist to clarify whether its policies comply with state law prohibiting discrimination against organ transplant patients based on vaccination status. This action comes amid reports that the hospital may have previously conditioned access to life-saving procedures, such as kidney transplants, on patients getting the COVID-19 vaccine.”\n\nHe cites House Bill 4076 (2025), now part of the Texas Health &amp; Safety Code §161.474, which bars healthcare providers from denying, delaying, or prioritizing transplant services based on "solely" vaccination status. \n\nThese bills are medically nonsensical but they still lead to harassment from government, create confusion among clinicians, and divert hospital resources away from actually useful patient care.

42	2025-10-14 14:51:19.544091	openai	\N	Hello all, I am early career peds subspecialty in an underserved area. I have never been angry at patients until today. For background, I work in an academic medical center. My no show rate is atrocious - easily 60-70%. This is refractory to overbooking and patient calls (families confirm they will be here the day before then suddenly change their plans). We can't charge no show fees (enforcing a policy for the 5% with private insurance isn't worth it). Discharging repeat offenders is a possibility, but I hate to punish the kids for the parents' issue. Clinical admin is supportive and wants to give this time. I make myself available to community providers to increase referral base.\n\nI normally love my job and find other stuff to do, but today my kids are out of school and I'm stuck in the clinic. What's worse is that the other clinics are busy; it's just me waiting for the chance to help people. I feel like I'm sacrificing my family for people who don't show up. \n\nI'd rather quit and do urgent care or locums if this keeps up. What's worse though is my contract's non compete is a 50 mile radius, but the wording would let me practice gen peds.\n\nHas anyone else solved this kind of problem?\n-------\nUpdate:\nThank you for all this support and useful suggestions! I don't have the energy to reply to everyone personally. Here are my responses to replies: \n\n"Set boundaries, you spineless fish! Patients need late fees and negative incentives to know how to treat you!" These responses made me the happiest! Is there a fancy psychology term for "escapist fantasy that helps you when you are sleep deprived, miss your kids, and feel like a piece of junk"?\n\n"Figure out why your patients are no showing before being a grump!" I actually have been doing a QI on this for the past 7 months. There is little identifiable rhyme or reason why people no show. Return pts no show ~40% and new pts no show ~60% (the original post was hyperbolic, my actual no show rate is 54%). There is no significant difference between NP and MD/DO referrals. Self referrals have better no show rates. The urgent referrals (e.g., PCP calls the link line or texts my cell) have an appointment offered within 1 week and they still have high no show rates!\n\n"Your patients are no showing for reasons, why don't you try empathy before judgement!" We already reach out to see how we can help, by phone, email, and Doximity text. We connect pts with transportation resources through their insurance. I offer telemed when appropriate. We have multiple off site locations to reduce barriers. ICE raids are largely a non issue in my community.\n\n"Dude, stop complaining about no-shows and take the free paycheck!" I normally find other ways to be productive. However today's free paycheck actually cost me time with my family. If something keeps you from your loved ones you would be angry too.  \n\n"That sucks, but this is what you signed up for." Thank you for commiserating. This is not what I signed up for; I signed up to help underserved people with rare disease. Congratulations to me, I lasted a whole 11 months as an attending before burnout. \n\nMany people offered actionable suggestions. Some have been tried and didn't help. Some were alternate ways of implementing ideas - I'll try some of those.

67	2025-10-14 14:52:12.476243	openai	\N	 As a personal trainer, I wanted to take the time to answer some of the most frequently asked questions by people who are new to working out. Feel free to let me know if I've missed anything!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How do I lose weight?\n\nIt’s actually way simpler than you might think: maintain a caloric deficit. Consume fewer calories than you burn. It doesn’t matter of you’re morbidly obese or you’re cutting for a show, this basic principal still applies. Note that eating a healthy diet makes this **far** easier - lots of fruits, veggies, lean protein and water will help you stay satiated for far fewer calories than fatty junk foods (not to mention you’ll have way more energy, and just feel better).\n\nTo find out how many calories you should be eating in a day to lose weight, you have a few different options. The first is to determine your maintenance calories with an online calculator, then subtract 250-500 per day from that (to lose about 0.5-1lbs per week). \n\nThe other option (my personal favourite, because everyone is different!) is to start by just honestly tallying up how much you’re currently eating each day. Once that’s determined, start by subtracting 250-500 calories per day. If you haven’t lost any weight in a couple weeks, subtract that amount again, until you start seeing progress.\n\nThere’s tons of food tracking apps out there, but I recommend [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) \\- it’s free, easy to use, you can scan food labels, and the food database included is enormous.\n\nAnother important note - increasing the amount of calories you burn per day (ie. exercising) will also help you stay in a caloric deficit. However, it’s best NOT to rely solely on this method. Doing a whole hour of cardio will only burn a few hundred calories (plus will likely make you hungry for snacks by the time you’re finished) … or, you can simply avoid eating a bag of chips or a piece of pizza, to have the exact same effect. \n\nThat’s not to imply that exercise isn’t important in your weight loss journey - quite the contrary! However, instead of focusing on doing hours of cardio a day, this should only be used to supplement your diet (1-2 hours a week is fine for most people). Your focus should instead be on resistance training. Lifting heavy weights 2-4 times per week plays the important role of ensuring you **maintain your muscle mass as you lose weight.** Want to avoid that “skinny fat” look, and get “toned” instead? Make sure you’re doing resistance training! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How do I lose weight in ___ area?\n\nUnfortunately, spot reduction is a myth. Where you lose weight first (and last) is determined by genetics. However, you \\*will\\* eventually lose weight in all your problem areas. You just need to be patient, and keep doing what helped you start losing weight in the first place.\n\n The good news is, the more weight you lose, the more visible the progress will be (especially if you’re doing a good job focusing on just fat loss, while retaining muscle). Going from 250-240lbs probably won’t be noticeable, but losing those last 10lbs will make a huge difference (since a few pounds will make up a far greater percentage of your total body mass). So the progress will be hard-fought for, but definitely worth it! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How do I gain muscle?\n\nIt’s a combination of progressively harder resistance training, eating enough food, and lots of patience.\n\nWhen you’re exercising, just going through the motions isn’t good enough. For optimal muscle gain, you should be performing each set with a weight that you can lift continuously for around 30-60s (this should amount to around 8-15 repetitions). If you feel like you can go for longer, choose a heavier weight. \n\nPerform each repetition slowly (about 1 second concentric, pause, 2-3 seconds eccentric, pause), through a full range of motion. To clarify - the concentric portion of a lift is when you’re moving against gravity, and the eccentric portion is when you’re moving with gravity. Exercises involving long static holds (like planks) are great for endurance, but they won’t amount to much muscle mass gained.\n\nI cannot overemphasize how important good form is either - for avoiding injury, hardwiring the correct neural pathways, and maximizing muscle gain. Especially when you’re just starting out, choose light weights, and make sure optimal form comes naturally before you start increasing the intensity. It’s way easier learning it correctly the first time than fixing bad habits later.\n\nHow much food should you be eating? It varies widely between people. Start with your maintenance calories, add a couple hundred to that (it doesn’t have to be a lot!), and measure your results. Be patient with your progress - men can expect to gain 1-2lbs of lean muscle a month, and 0.5-1lbs for women (beginners may gain a little faster). Eating enough protein is also vital to gaining muscle - a general rule of thumb is around 1 gram of protein (each day) per pound of lean body weight (ie. how much you weigh, minus the amount of fat you have). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How do I get stronger?\n\nIt honestly depends on your experience level. If you’re just starting out, doing a normal resistance routine focused on gaining muscle will make you stronger. However, if you’ve been working out regularly for awhile (close to a year), using heavier weights (1-6 reps max) will help you get stronger a lot faster. \n\nIf you’re focusing more purely on strength gain, it’s important that each repetition is done as perfectly as possible (even moreso than for other training goals). That means stopping 1-2 reps shy of failure. Doing just one sloppy rep can severely impact your strength output for the rest of the workout. Don’t be afraid of taking longer rests between sets either (up to 2-3 minutes), as you want to be ready with as much energy as possible before you start your next set. It also goes without saying that heavier weight = greater chance for injury, and proper form will help prevent that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Is it possible to lose fat and build muscle at the same time?\n\nContrary to popular belief - yes. Especially if you’re a beginner! Just make sure you’re eating around maintenance level calories (along with enough protein), doing resistance training 3-4 times a week, and you’ll start seeing body composition changes. \n\nHowever, if you’re significantly over/underweight, or have already been working out for some time, you’ll see much faster progress if you focus on one goal at a time. The main difference here is going to be diet - eating less if you’re trying to lose weight, or eating more if you’re trying to gain weight. Regular resistance training plays a part in both shedding fat and gaining muscle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How should I be structuring my workouts?\n\nFor the vast majority of people, full body workouts with compound exercises is the way to go. (For those who don’t know, compound exercises are those which use more than one joint at a time - think squats, bench press, rows, etc.)\n\nThe popular back/chest/shoulders/arms/legs split routine (or any variation of it) is good for advanced bodybuilders, but not ideal for beginners. Bodybuilders exercise like this because they need a much greater stimulus to properly stress any given muscle group, and more rest between days training that muscle group as a result of their increased workout intensity.\n\nFor a beginner, it’s better to hit each muscle group multiple times a week (this is great to hasten learning and growth). You won’t need as long of a rest period before training the same muscle again, because it won’t be as fatigued after each workout.\n\nCompound exercises give you the greatest bang for your buck because you’re working out so many muscles in one movement (and burning way more calories at the same time). Isolation exercises (those working one joint at a time, like bicep curls or leg extensions) are best for bodybuilders who really need to hone in on a single muscle.\n\nDoing resistance training 3-4 times a week is a good goal to shoot for. Workouts should be around 45-60 minutes, with around 6-8 exercises done during that time. Try to keep rests between sets to around 60s (this is all very generalized, and can change depending on experience level and goal). Space rest days evenly between workouts if you can.\n\nStart your workouts with the exercises which require the most energy (usually those which involve lifting the most weight), saving any isolation/ab exercises for the end.\n\nIf you’d like some help planning your workout routine, I just released a fitness app called [PerfectFit](https://www.perfect-fit.app/). It gives you access to workouts designed by a personal trainer, all customized according to your unique goals, fitness level, and available equipment. There are tons of bodyweight exercises included - ideal for anyone working out at home! The app is currently available to download on Android, and iOS is hopefully just a few days away (currently under review).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### What should I be eating?\n\nIf your goal is a change in body composition (gaining muscle/losing fat), the amount of calories you’re consuming is the most important thing to pay attention to.\n\nIf you’re consistently working out hard but failing to gain/lose weight, chances are you need to make alterations to your diet. For weight loss, that usually means eating at a deficit of 250-500 calories per day; for weight gain, eating at a surplus of 200-300 calories per day.\n\nWhat exact foods you’re eating has an impact on how easily you can stick to your calorie goals, as well as your energy levels.\n\nConsuming around 1 gram of protein per pound of lean bodyweight (per day) is a given, regardless of what your fitness goal is. This helps to maintain satiety, and preserve/increase muscle mass.\n\nEating lots of fruits and veggies (as well as drinking 2-3L of water a day - more for some people) is a great way to feel full without consuming too many calories. It also just contributes to all-around health and energy levels.\n\nEating lots of fatty foods should be avoided if weight loss is the goal - not because fat makes you fat per se, but because they are so calorically dense. Only one tablespoon of peanut butter or olive oil is 100 calories! Conversely, if your goal is to **gain** weight, adding more fatty foods to your diet (healthy fats, if possible) can help you hit that calorie goal easier.\n\nAnd carbs? Not as evil as people make them out to be. Think of them as the energy that fuels your brain and your workouts. Having around 50% of your calories coming from carbs is about the norm. It’s likely beneficial to raise this number even higher if you’re an especially lean individual, or you’re regularly working out at intense levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### When should I be eating?\n\nThe easiest way to time your meals properly is to think: “What will I be doing in the next 2-3 hours?” Eat according to the activity you’re about to do. That doesn’t mean you should be having a giant meal right before your workout, but ideally your biggest meal of the day would be several hours before you exercise. This will give you the energy you need, plus ensure the calories you consume are shuttled into your muscles instead of fat reserves.\n\nIf you’re about to do an intense workout, the best thing to eat beforehand (around 15-30 minutes prior) is a light snack of healthy carbs (like some fruit). For optimal recovery, aim for 20-30g of protein within an hour after you workout (if you miss this window though don’t worry about it). A protein shake is probably the simplest and most convenient way of doing this, but whole food is just as good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### What supplements should I be taking?\n\nIf you have a healthy, well-rounded diet, including 2-3 cups of different veggies each day,  enough protein per pound of bodyweight (from sources that include sufficient amounts of each essential amino acid), and adequate omega-3 fatty acids - then you’re golden, and probably don’t need any supplements.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of the population would probably benefit from a simple multivitamin and omega-3 supplement, just to help fill any nutritional gaps they have.\n\nIf you’re getting enough protein from whole food, then you probably don’t need to add protein powder. However, if you’re struggling with this, then protein powder is a great way to easily increase your daily protein intake. Whey protein is the most bioavailable and has a complete amino acid profile, so it’s the best choice for most people. However, if you’re vegan (or lactose intolerant), there are lots of plant proteins available. You just need to pay attention to the amino acid profile of each one (possibly mixing and matching different plant sources if you need to).\n\nAs for all the other supplements out there, it’s honestly on a case-by-case basis as to whether they’d actually help you or not. If you’re a beginner, unless you have any specific requirements or deficits, you probably don’t need them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Is stretching important?\n\nYes. Please stretch (or do some other form of myofascial release, such as foam rolling), or you’ll eventually regret it. Regular exercise makes your muscles slowly form clumps of tissue and fascia. Neglecting to release these can result in restricted range of motion, and eventually pain.\n\nStatic stretching should be done at the **end** of your workout. Aim to stretch each worked muscle near its end range of motion for around 60s total. Don’t stretch before your workout, as this can impede strength output.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Is warming up important?\n\nYes. Warming up is paramount to increasing blood flow and activating your muscles properly before you move onto more intense, metabolically demanding exercises. \n\nIdeally, during your warm-up, you should be actively moving your muscles through the same ranges of motion you’ll be doing for your workout. This can be as simple as doing the exact same movement, but with minimal weight - for example, doing a few sets of bodyweight squats before doing barbell squats.\n\nYou want your warm-ups to elevate your heart rate, but not be so intense that they start tiring you out and detract from your workout. Usually 5-10 minutes of light activity is enough.

This is meant to be a community/collaborative effort, so please add in suggestions in the comments!\n\nTo be clear on a couple terms -- when exercising and eating to gain weight, that is called __bulking__ (aka caloric "surplus"). Eating less to lose weight is called __cutting__ (aka caloric "deficit"). And eating just enough to not gain or lose weight is called __maintenance__ (aka recomposition or "recomp").\n\n## A visual guide to male and female BF% estimates\n\n-   [From athleanx](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8IPmtkFYQx/?igshid=17upb60h7gk3)\n\nI don't like guessing BF% as there's no way to know how much visceral fat we store internally. But athleanx's general guidelines are as good as any for visual estimates.\n\n## Who should cut or bulk?\n\nThe idea behind cut and bulk cycles is to gain muscle and fat in a bulk phase and then try to keep all your muscle and burn off fat in a cut phase. This approach is generally 'faster', when done correctly, than "recomps" (recompositions) where you maintain your weight but work out hard and try to replace fat with muscle.\n\nGenerally speaking, if you're an active person and/or consistently working out, you can do cut/bulk cycles. To get started, you need to know your maintenance calories ("maint") to have an idea on how many calories you can consume without gaining or losing weight, hence the term maintenance; no change in weight. To bulk, you eat more than maintenance (aka "surplus") and to cut you eat less than maintenance (aka "deficit"). If you *are not* working out and you bulk, that's how you get fat. So don't eat above maint if you're not also working out.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started, you need to know your "maintenance" calorie needs and for an estimate you need a TDEE calculator (I like [this one](https://tdeecalculator.net/), but you can google for others). Think of this as a starting point to use that will need some adjusting over time.\n\nOnce you have an estimated maintenance, you generally add 250-500 calories for a bulk and subtract 250-750 calories in a cut. Generally, it's safer to over-do cuts and under-do bulks. In a bulk you gain both fat and muscle and after a point you only gain fat (fat stores faster than you can build new muscle), so be cautious in bulks and don't "dirty" bulk.\n\n## Deciding to cut or bulk\n\nSo far as I'm aware, there isn't a hard science behind *when* to bulk or cut, but there are guidelines to consider. When bulking, our bodies build muscle *and* store fat and, after a point, our bodies prioritize storing fat over building muscle. This is why dirty bulking is bad and, generally speaking, if your BF% is &gt; 20%, you should not bulk. Any higher BF% and your body tends to prioritize fat storage vs muscle gained from bulking.\n\nSimilarly, cuts are usually done to around 10% because any lower than that and the body will begin to consume more muscle than fat and muscle loss is more likely.\n\nYou *can* make strength gains on a cut. You can't build new muscle, but you can "refactor" (that's my word for it, I'm sure there's a scientific one) existing muscle to be more efficient, hence stronger, as you lose fat. Also, repetitive gym visits will help you become more proficient at working out which helps in the long run when you start bulking and building new muscle.\n\nIf you're really unsure, you can make a post in [r/BulkOrCut](https://www.reddit.com/r/BulkOrCut/) to get community feedback on what it's you personally should do.\n\nIf you're skinnyfat, generally you can eat at a small maintenance (aka "clean bulk") and make great strength gains. If you have little muscle mass to cut to, you will just look tiny/thin -- especially if you're tall. So for most skinnyfat people, and I would clean bulk and diligently follow a legit lifting routine. Which brings me to...\n\n## Workout routines\n\nBefore getting into routines, I think it's worth mentioning first that everyone should walk more. At least 5 times per week, 30 minutes per day:\n\n-   [Get ripped. Get walking.](https://www.t-nation.com/training/get-ripped-get-walking)\n\nCheck out [The Beginner's Guide to Working Out](https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/ihz264/beginners_guide_to_working_out/)\n\nThe best workout routine is the one you can consistently follow. If you're new to the gym, just about anything will get you some results. To a point. If you want to be smart about it, do not make up your own routine! There are plenty of legit, tried-and-true, FREE [recommended lifting routines](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/) to choose from. I like these routines vs googling something random because these are routines many, many people in various subreddits are doing and have done in the past that can help answer any questions you might have. It's nice to have someone else that is doing or has done the program you're running to offer direct advice from their experience. But you can just google other routines if you want. Just make sure it has:\n\n-   1.  Progressive overload\n\n-   2) Structured days to not hit body parts more than 2x/week\n\nIf you're working out at home, check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/GovSchwarzenegger/comments/flz3es/stay_at_home_stay_fit/) from Arnold Schwarzenegger with a detailed bodyweight home routine.\n\nAlso another great [full body workout](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA3ajQZjUTx/) for people at home with no equipment.\n\n## What to eat\n\nAt the end of the day, for 99% of people (various diseases, ailments, and conditions aside), all that matters are Calories In, Calories Out (CICO). This controls weight gain and loss. Lifting heavy weights encourages strength gains or at least strength maintenance in both surplus/bulks and deficit/cuts. But to gain or lose lbs on a scale, the total calories consumed minus calories used and the resulting surplus/deficit are what matters. But how much of what you eat matters...\n\nThere's a lot of suggested science over what to eat, but there are generally sound rules of thumbs to follow which are easily broken down into "Macros" for tracking purposes:\n\n-   Proteins (1 gram = 4 calories)\n\n-   Carbs (1 gram = 4 calories)\n\n-   Fats (1 gram = 9 calories)\n\nCollectively, all the macros we consume = total consumption (Calories In). When cutting, it's easiest to cut down fats and carbs. But keep protein high. When bulking, generally you add carbs and/or fats. Protein should always be high; it's what helps build muscle directly.\n\nHowever, *how we feel* when consuming these calories and what we get out of other nutrients is important.\n\n#### Fats\n\nWe all need healthy fats to help regulate hormonal balances. This is usually room-temp fats (think extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, various nuts, avocados, etc); less important are the fats in meat and dairy products, for example. A general rule of thumb is to aim for at least 30% x total calories for your fats macro. This is the same for cutting or bulking, but when bulking you can increase if you want.\n\nE.g. if you're consuming 2000 calories daily, aim for 0.3x2000 (600) calories to be from fats.\n\n#### Carbs\n\nNext come carbs. Carbs are not evil. They're a tool. Our body prefers and relies on carbs to refuel energy stores. Simple, nutrient-dense carbs are preferred -- not complex or junk carbs. The reason for this is 1) satiation, how long we'll feel full, and 2) other nutrient content. When you can, get your carbs from fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. That will do far more for you than crackers, cereal, donuts, etc. Even though the carbs will be utilized equally, produce holds far more vitamins and minerals that have relevant health and recovery benefits that can't be overstated.\n\nGenerally, aim for 25-45% of your calories to be carbs (depending on cutting/bulking).\n\n#### Protein\n\nGenerally, you want to keep protein fairly high. Anywhere from .75-1+ gram of protein per lbs of body weight. This can come from any source, as our body will utilize them the same. But some sources are preferred, depending on whether you're cutting or bulking. Ideally, aim for now more than 40-50 grams per meal/protein shake and spread out the consumption through the day.\n\nThe remainder of your calories should be protein.\n\n#### Timing\n\nAs carbs are for energy, many people prefer to have more carbs timed around workouts (and no fats during this period) to help boost performance and recovery. If you're going to eat your carbs (e.g. rice and chicken breast), do so about two hours before working out; otherwise, liquid/quickly consumed carbs are preferred (e.g. orange or apple juice). Again, post-workout, get simple carbs and protein into your system via a shake or meal fairly soon. Save fats for well-before or after workouts.\n\n##Measuring success\n\nFirst and foremost, gym progress should always be factored in first. If your routine says X lift should go up Y amount each week, generally you want to be hitting that to know you're on track. If your lift #s are going up according to your routine, you're doing great! If you aren't, there's a breakdown somewhere and you should ask for guidance if you cannot asses the fail point yourself.\n\nSecondly, the weight scale. You want to make sure your body weight is trending in your goal direction. It's ideal to weigh yourself *the same way* every time.\n\nFor example, I wake up, go to the bathroom, and then weigh myself every day for three weeks and then I average my daily changes over those three weeks. I generally aim to gain .5-.75 lbs per week and lose .75-1 lbs per week. If I'm gaining or losing too much, I adjust my macros ~ 250 calories and measure again for three weeks and so on.\n\nDon't get caught up daily changes; I sometimes vary 3-5 lbs between days! Weigh daily for three weeks and average it out. Don't worry about the daily weight, find an average to determine where the trend is taking you and adjust if needed. This will take the annoying variances out of the picture and let you focus on meaningful change.\n\nYou can also measure your wrists, waist, neck, etc, as well as take photos, but that's more preference and not as commonly suggested.\n\n##Bulking and cutting strategies\n\nI've seen people make amazing progress, both gaining and losing weight, in a variety of ways. Ideally, be healthy. Emphasize fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. But, at the end of the day, many approaches work. You can bulk or cut as a vegan, intermittent fasting ("IF"), KETO, IIFYM, etc. Many approaches work. They are but tools available to you, so find one that best helps you meet your goal. So choose the best "diet" or tool that helps you achieve a goal! If that's keto, great! If that's caveman, awesome. I don't care! Limit your calories in whatever "diet" you choose and you'll see results.\n\nIn my opinion, it's better to make *lifestyle* changes that to follow a diet for a short time. So I don't really like "diets" per se, but more so recommend eating like an adult and limiting calories. But even still, different tactics can help in that goal, and you can deploy as many or as few as you want:\n\n-   Intermittent Fasting ("IF")\n\n-   Tracking macros / IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros)\n\n-   "Banking" calories\n\nI don't buy into the other 'benefits' of IF, but it was a tactic that worked for me. I am a volume eater. I generally eat well, but I like eating *a lot*. So when I'm cutting, my meals were small and sad. The idea behind IF is that you have a short window of time which you eat meals, the rest of the day you fast. Again, all that matters are calories. You can absolutely get fat eating 10k calories in a 5 hour window. So there's no magic in doing this. But for me, doing IF allowed me to have larger, more satiating meals within the "eating window" instead of more, smaller meals.\n\nMacros are discussed above, but the idea behind IIFYM is that you've a set # for each macro and, so long as what you're eating fits neatly into the prescribed macro allotment, go for eating whatever you want! And, again, so long as total calories are low enough for you, you will lose weight. But this is [r/BulkorCut](https://www.reddit.com/r/BulkorCut/), not [r/weightloss](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightloss/). People here are also working out. How well you workout, recover, perform, feel, etc is affected by what you eat. So, sure, add in "fun" foods sometimes. But don't eat like a child simply because it fit your macros. A safe rule of thumb is to eat "cleanly" 80% of the time when bulking, whatever the other 20% of the time. When cutting, I try to eat cleanly 90-95% of the time with fewer treats. What that treat is might change -- some weeks I just want pancakes, other weeks I just want a couple beers. Do what works for you, just do so in controlled quantities.\n\nI liked "banking" calories when I knew I had a special event, date night with the wife, party, or whatever where I'd be consuming extra calories. One way to account for that is to deduct an *additional* amount of calories each day leading up to the event, to then splurge on that event. Example:\n\nLet's say my maintenance is 2,500 calories and I'm eating at a -500 deficit, so I'm eating 2,000 calories daily. I want to take my wife out for our anniversary, so the week leading up to our date night I deduct an additional -250 calories each day and only eat 1,750 calories daily. This gives me 7x250 (=1750) "banked" calories I can add to my 2,000 calories on our anniversary. Now I can have a nice dinner, dessert, a drink or two, all without blowing my diet out of whack!\n\n##Body fat % (BF%) estimates\n\nEstimating ones body fat % is kind of hard. We can't see how much fat is stored internally around organs; some people store more fat over the abs, some more around their love handles (that's me!), and others in their legs/ass. So it's really hard to tell. There are various ways to scan BF%, but most are imprecise with a +/- 20% variance. In my opinion, the only thing they're useful for is estimating BF% *changes*. Let's say it reads 20% for you; in six months, you try again and it says 15%. You probably lost around 5% BF%, but your actual BF% might be 12%-18%. So it's not a particularly accurate reading, but the rate change is a useful gauge.\n\nThe best ways to learn BF% are via:\n\n-   Underwater Weighing (Hydrostatic Weighing) (1-2% variance)\n\n-   DEXA scan (1-2% variance)\n\nEverything else has huge variance and is only useful for measuring rate of change.\n\n##Differences in males and females\n\n-   Basically, [there aren't any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HToXo6gS7-s)\n\n-   It ultimately comes down to goals and therefore what you're going to emphasize/work towards.\n\n##Useful posts/resources\n\n-   [The Absolute Beginner's Guide to the Gym](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cg9c8d/the_absolute_beginners_guide_to_the_gym/)\n\n-   [To Bulk And Cut Or Not To Bulk And Cut](https://bretcontreras.com/to-bulk-and-cut-or-not/)\n\n-   [Here is a credible, no BS approach to getting abs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsph7_-pizw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=146)\n\n##People to follow\n\n-   [pheasyque](https://www.instagram.com/pheasyque/) - excellent diagrams, tutorials, and generally great content on how to lift properly\n\n-   [Stefi Cohen](https://www.instagram.com/steficohen/) - 22 world records, doctorate in physical therapy, gym owner, coach.

64	2025-10-14 14:52:12.392512	openai	\N	 As a personal trainer, I wanted to take the time to answer some of the most frequently asked questions by people who are new to working out. Feel free to let me know if I've missed anything!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How do I lose weight?\n\nIt’s actually way simpler than you might think: maintain a caloric deficit. Consume fewer calories than you burn. It doesn’t matter of you’re morbidly obese or you’re cutting for a show, this basic principal still applies. Note that eating a healthy diet makes this **far** easier - lots of fruits, veggies, lean protein and water will help you stay satiated for far fewer calories than fatty junk foods (not to mention you’ll have way more energy, and just feel better).\n\nTo find out how many calories you should be eating in a day to lose weight, you have a few different options. The first is to determine your maintenance calories with an online calculator, then subtract 250-500 per day from that (to lose about 0.5-1lbs per week). \n\nThe other option (my personal favourite, because everyone is different!) is to start by just honestly tallying up how much you’re currently eating each day. Once that’s determined, start by subtracting 250-500 calories per day. If you haven’t lost any weight in a couple weeks, subtract that amount again, until you start seeing progress.\n\nThere’s tons of food tracking apps out there, but I recommend [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) \\- it’s free, easy to use, you can scan food labels, and the food database included is enormous.\n\nAnother important note - increasing the amount of calories you burn per day (ie. exercising) will also help you stay in a caloric deficit. However, it’s best NOT to rely solely on this method. Doing a whole hour of cardio will only burn a few hundred calories (plus will likely make you hungry for snacks by the time you’re finished) … or, you can simply avoid eating a bag of chips or a piece of pizza, to have the exact same effect. \n\nThat’s not to imply that exercise isn’t important in your weight loss journey - quite the contrary! However, instead of focusing on doing hours of cardio a day, this should only be used to supplement your diet (1-2 hours a week is fine for most people). Your focus should instead be on resistance training. Lifting heavy weights 2-4 times per week plays the important role of ensuring you **maintain your muscle mass as you lose weight.** Want to avoid that “skinny fat” look, and get “toned” instead? Make sure you’re doing resistance training! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How do I lose weight in ___ area?\n\nUnfortunately, spot reduction is a myth. Where you lose weight first (and last) is determined by genetics. However, you \\*will\\* eventually lose weight in all your problem areas. You just need to be patient, and keep doing what helped you start losing weight in the first place.\n\n The good news is, the more weight you lose, the more visible the progress will be (especially if you’re doing a good job focusing on just fat loss, while retaining muscle). Going from 250-240lbs probably won’t be noticeable, but losing those last 10lbs will make a huge difference (since a few pounds will make up a far greater percentage of your total body mass). So the progress will be hard-fought for, but definitely worth it! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How do I gain muscle?\n\nIt’s a combination of progressively harder resistance training, eating enough food, and lots of patience.\n\nWhen you’re exercising, just going through the motions isn’t good enough. For optimal muscle gain, you should be performing each set with a weight that you can lift continuously for around 30-60s (this should amount to around 8-15 repetitions). If you feel like you can go for longer, choose a heavier weight. \n\nPerform each repetition slowly (about 1 second concentric, pause, 2-3 seconds eccentric, pause), through a full range of motion. To clarify - the concentric portion of a lift is when you’re moving against gravity, and the eccentric portion is when you’re moving with gravity. Exercises involving long static holds (like planks) are great for endurance, but they won’t amount to much muscle mass gained.\n\nI cannot overemphasize how important good form is either - for avoiding injury, hardwiring the correct neural pathways, and maximizing muscle gain. Especially when you’re just starting out, choose light weights, and make sure optimal form comes naturally before you start increasing the intensity. It’s way easier learning it correctly the first time than fixing bad habits later.\n\nHow much food should you be eating? It varies widely between people. Start with your maintenance calories, add a couple hundred to that (it doesn’t have to be a lot!), and measure your results. Be patient with your progress - men can expect to gain 1-2lbs of lean muscle a month, and 0.5-1lbs for women (beginners may gain a little faster). Eating enough protein is also vital to gaining muscle - a general rule of thumb is around 1 gram of protein (each day) per pound of lean body weight (ie. how much you weigh, minus the amount of fat you have). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How do I get stronger?\n\nIt honestly depends on your experience level. If you’re just starting out, doing a normal resistance routine focused on gaining muscle will make you stronger. However, if you’ve been working out regularly for awhile (close to a year), using heavier weights (1-6 reps max) will help you get stronger a lot faster. \n\nIf you’re focusing more purely on strength gain, it’s important that each repetition is done as perfectly as possible (even moreso than for other training goals). That means stopping 1-2 reps shy of failure. Doing just one sloppy rep can severely impact your strength output for the rest of the workout. Don’t be afraid of taking longer rests between sets either (up to 2-3 minutes), as you want to be ready with as much energy as possible before you start your next set. It also goes without saying that heavier weight = greater chance for injury, and proper form will help prevent that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Is it possible to lose fat and build muscle at the same time?\n\nContrary to popular belief - yes. Especially if you’re a beginner! Just make sure you’re eating around maintenance level calories (along with enough protein), doing resistance training 3-4 times a week, and you’ll start seeing body composition changes. \n\nHowever, if you’re significantly over/underweight, or have already been working out for some time, you’ll see much faster progress if you focus on one goal at a time. The main difference here is going to be diet - eating less if you’re trying to lose weight, or eating more if you’re trying to gain weight. Regular resistance training plays a part in both shedding fat and gaining muscle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How should I be structuring my workouts?\n\nFor the vast majority of people, full body workouts with compound exercises is the way to go. (For those who don’t know, compound exercises are those which use more than one joint at a time - think squats, bench press, rows, etc.)\n\nThe popular back/chest/shoulders/arms/legs split routine (or any variation of it) is good for advanced bodybuilders, but not ideal for beginners. Bodybuilders exercise like this because they need a much greater stimulus to properly stress any given muscle group, and more rest between days training that muscle group as a result of their increased workout intensity.\n\nFor a beginner, it’s better to hit each muscle group multiple times a week (this is great to hasten learning and growth). You won’t need as long of a rest period before training the same muscle again, because it won’t be as fatigued after each workout.\n\nCompound exercises give you the greatest bang for your buck because you’re working out so many muscles in one movement (and burning way more calories at the same time). Isolation exercises (those working one joint at a time, like bicep curls or leg extensions) are best for bodybuilders who really need to hone in on a single muscle.\n\nDoing resistance training 3-4 times a week is a good goal to shoot for. Workouts should be around 45-60 minutes, with around 6-8 exercises done during that time. Try to keep rests between sets to around 60s (this is all very generalized, and can change depending on experience level and goal). Space rest days evenly between workouts if you can.\n\nStart your workouts with the exercises which require the most energy (usually those which involve lifting the most weight), saving any isolation/ab exercises for the end.\n\nIf you’d like some help planning your workout routine, I just released a fitness app called [PerfectFit](https://www.perfect-fit.app/). It gives you access to workouts designed by a personal trainer, all customized according to your unique goals, fitness level, and available equipment. There are tons of bodyweight exercises included - ideal for anyone working out at home! The app is currently available to download on Android, and iOS is hopefully just a few days away (currently under review).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### What should I be eating?\n\nIf your goal is a change in body composition (gaining muscle/losing fat), the amount of calories you’re consuming is the most important thing to pay attention to.\n\nIf you’re consistently working out hard but failing to gain/lose weight, chances are you need to make alterations to your diet. For weight loss, that usually means eating at a deficit of 250-500 calories per day; for weight gain, eating at a surplus of 200-300 calories per day.\n\nWhat exact foods you’re eating has an impact on how easily you can stick to your calorie goals, as well as your energy levels.\n\nConsuming around 1 gram of protein per pound of lean bodyweight (per day) is a given, regardless of what your fitness goal is. This helps to maintain satiety, and preserve/increase muscle mass.\n\nEating lots of fruits and veggies (as well as drinking 2-3L of water a day - more for some people) is a great way to feel full without consuming too many calories. It also just contributes to all-around health and energy levels.\n\nEating lots of fatty foods should be avoided if weight loss is the goal - not because fat makes you fat per se, but because they are so calorically dense. Only one tablespoon of peanut butter or olive oil is 100 calories! Conversely, if your goal is to **gain** weight, adding more fatty foods to your diet (healthy fats, if possible) can help you hit that calorie goal easier.\n\nAnd carbs? Not as evil as people make them out to be. Think of them as the energy that fuels your brain and your workouts. Having around 50% of your calories coming from carbs is about the norm. It’s likely beneficial to raise this number even higher if you’re an especially lean individual, or you’re regularly working out at intense levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### When should I be eating?\n\nThe easiest way to time your meals properly is to think: “What will I be doing in the next 2-3 hours?” Eat according to the activity you’re about to do. That doesn’t mean you should be having a giant meal right before your workout, but ideally your biggest meal of the day would be several hours before you exercise. This will give you the energy you need, plus ensure the calories you consume are shuttled into your muscles instead of fat reserves.\n\nIf you’re about to do an intense workout, the best thing to eat beforehand (around 15-30 minutes prior) is a light snack of healthy carbs (like some fruit). For optimal recovery, aim for 20-30g of protein within an hour after you workout (if you miss this window though don’t worry about it). A protein shake is probably the simplest and most convenient way of doing this, but whole food is just as good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### What supplements should I be taking?\n\nIf you have a healthy, well-rounded diet, including 2-3 cups of different veggies each day,  enough protein per pound of bodyweight (from sources that include sufficient amounts of each essential amino acid), and adequate omega-3 fatty acids - then you’re golden, and probably don’t need any supplements.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of the population would probably benefit from a simple multivitamin and omega-3 supplement, just to help fill any nutritional gaps they have.\n\nIf you’re getting enough protein from whole food, then you probably don’t need to add protein powder. However, if you’re struggling with this, then protein powder is a great way to easily increase your daily protein intake. Whey protein is the most bioavailable and has a complete amino acid profile, so it’s the best choice for most people. However, if you’re vegan (or lactose intolerant), there are lots of plant proteins available. You just need to pay attention to the amino acid profile of each one (possibly mixing and matching different plant sources if you need to).\n\nAs for all the other supplements out there, it’s honestly on a case-by-case basis as to whether they’d actually help you or not. If you’re a beginner, unless you have any specific requirements or deficits, you probably don’t need them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Is stretching important?\n\nYes. Please stretch (or do some other form of myofascial release, such as foam rolling), or you’ll eventually regret it. Regular exercise makes your muscles slowly form clumps of tissue and fascia. Neglecting to release these can result in restricted range of motion, and eventually pain.\n\nStatic stretching should be done at the **end** of your workout. Aim to stretch each worked muscle near its end range of motion for around 60s total. Don’t stretch before your workout, as this can impede strength output.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Is warming up important?\n\nYes. Warming up is paramount to increasing blood flow and activating your muscles properly before you move onto more intense, metabolically demanding exercises. \n\nIdeally, during your warm-up, you should be actively moving your muscles through the same ranges of motion you’ll be doing for your workout. This can be as simple as doing the exact same movement, but with minimal weight - for example, doing a few sets of bodyweight squats before doing barbell squats.\n\nYou want your warm-ups to elevate your heart rate, but not be so intense that they start tiring you out and detract from your workout. Usually 5-10 minutes of light activity is enough.

Ideas, suggestions, guides, workouts, etc -- everything you'll need to answer 99% of questions! This is meant to be a community/collaborative effort, so please add in suggestions in the comments!\n\nTo be clear on a couple terms -- when exercising and eating to gain weight, that is called __bulking__ (aka caloric "surplus"). Eating less to lose weight is called __cutting__ (aka caloric "deficit"). And eating just enough to not gain or lose weight is called __maintenance__ (aka recomposition or "recomp").\n\n## A visual guide to male and female BF% estimates\n\n-   [From athleanx](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8IPmtkFYQx/?igshid=17upb60h7gk3)\n\nI don't like guessing BF% as there's no way to know how much visceral fat we store internally. But athleanx's general guidelines are as good as any for visual estimates.\n\n## Who should cut or bulk?\n\nThe idea behind cut and bulk cycles is to gain muscle and fat in a bulk phase and then try to keep all your muscle and burn off fat in a cut phase. This approach is generally 'faster', when done correctly, than "recomps" (recompositions) where you maintain your weight but work out hard and try to replace fat with muscle.\n\nGenerally speaking, if you're an active person and/or consistently working out, you can do cut/bulk cycles. To get started, you need to know your maintenance calories ("maint") to have an idea on how many calories you can consume without gaining or losing weight, hence the term maintenance; no change in weight. To bulk, you eat more than maintenance (aka "surplus") and to cut you eat less than maintenance (aka "deficit"). If you *are not* working out and you bulk, that's how you get fat. So don't eat above maint if you're not also working out.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started, you need to know your "maintenance" calorie needs and for an estimate you need a TDEE calculator (I like [this one](https://tdeecalculator.net/), but you can google for others). Think of this as a starting point to use that will need some adjusting over time.\n\nOnce you have an estimated maintenance, you generally add 250-500 calories for a bulk and subtract 250-750 calories in a cut. Generally, it's safer to over-do cuts and under-do bulks. In a bulk you gain both fat and muscle and after a point you only gain fat (fat stores faster than you can build new muscle), so be cautious in bulks and don't "dirty" bulk.\n\n## Deciding to cut or bulk\n\nSo far as I'm aware, there isn't a hard science behind *when* to bulk or cut, but there are guidelines to consider. When bulking, our bodies build muscle *and* store fat and, after a point, our bodies prioritize storing fat over building muscle. This is why dirty bulking is bad and, generally speaking, if your BF% is &gt; 20%, you should not bulk. Any higher BF% and your body tends to prioritize fat storage vs muscle gained from bulking.\n\nSimilarly, cuts are usually done to around 10% because any lower than that and the body will begin to consume more muscle than fat and muscle loss is more likely.\n\nYou *can* make strength gains on a cut. You can't build new muscle, but you can "refactor" (that's my word for it, I'm sure there's a scientific one) existing muscle to be more efficient, hence stronger, as you lose fat. Also, repetitive gym visits will help you become more proficient at working out which helps in the long run when you start bulking and building new muscle.\n\nIf you're really unsure, you can make a post in [r/BulkOrCut](https://www.reddit.com/r/BulkOrCut/) to get community feedback on what it's you personally should do.\n\nIf you're skinnyfat, generally you can eat at a small maintenance (aka "clean bulk") and make great strength gains. If you have little muscle mass to cut to, you will just look tiny/thin -- especially if you're tall. So for most skinnyfat people, and I would clean bulk and diligently follow a legit lifting routine. Which brings me to...\n\n## Workout routines\n\nBefore getting into routines, I think it's worth mentioning first that everyone should walk more. At least 5 times per week, 30 minutes per day:\n\n-   [Get ripped. Get walking.](https://www.t-nation.com/training/get-ripped-get-walking)\n\nCheck out [The Beginner's Guide to Working Out](https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/ihz264/beginners_guide_to_working_out/)\n\nThe best workout routine is the one you can consistently follow. If you're new to the gym, just about anything will get you some results. To a point. If you want to be smart about it, do not make up your own routine! There are plenty of legit, tried-and-true, FREE [recommended lifting routines](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/) to choose from. I like these routines vs googling something random because these are routines many, many people in various subreddits are doing and have done in the past that can help answer any questions you might have. It's nice to have someone else that is doing or has done the program you're running to offer direct advice from their experience. But you can just google other routines if you want. Just make sure it has:\n\n-   1.  Progressive overload\n\n-   2) Structured days to not hit body parts more than 2x/week\n\nIf you're working out at home, check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/GovSchwarzenegger/comments/flz3es/stay_at_home_stay_fit/) from Arnold Schwarzenegger with a detailed bodyweight home routine.\n\nAlso another great [full body workout](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA3ajQZjUTx/) for people at home with no equipment.\n\n## What to eat\n\nAt the end of the day, for 99% of people (various diseases, ailments, and conditions aside), all that matters are Calories In, Calories Out (CICO). This controls weight gain and loss. Lifting heavy weights encourages strength gains or at least strength maintenance in both surplus/bulks and deficit/cuts. But to gain or lose lbs on a scale, the total calories consumed minus calories used and the resulting surplus/deficit are what matters. But how much of what you eat matters...\n\nThere's a lot of suggested science over what to eat, but there are generally sound rules of thumbs to follow which are easily broken down into "Macros" for tracking purposes:\n\n-   Proteins (1 gram = 4 calories)\n\n-   Carbs (1 gram = 4 calories)\n\n-   Fats (1 gram = 9 calories)\n\nCollectively, all the macros we consume = total consumption (Calories In). When cutting, it's easiest to cut down fats and carbs. But keep protein high. When bulking, generally you add carbs and/or fats. Protein should always be high; it's what helps build muscle directly.\n\nHowever, *how we feel* when consuming these calories and what we get out of other nutrients is important.\n\n#### Fats\n\nWe all need healthy fats to help regulate hormonal balances. This is usually room-temp fats (think extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, various nuts, avocados, etc); less important are the fats in meat and dairy products, for example. A general rule of thumb is to aim for at least 30% x total calories for your fats macro. This is the same for cutting or bulking, but when bulking you can increase if you want.\n\nE.g. if you're consuming 2000 calories daily, aim for 0.3x2000 (600) calories to be from fats.\n\n#### Carbs\n\nNext come carbs. Carbs are not evil. They're a tool. Our body prefers and relies on carbs to refuel energy stores. Simple, nutrient-dense carbs are preferred -- not complex or junk carbs. The reason for this is 1) satiation, how long we'll feel full, and 2) other nutrient content. When you can, get your carbs from fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. That will do far more for you than crackers, cereal, donuts, etc. Even though the carbs will be utilized equally, produce holds far more vitamins and minerals that have relevant health and recovery benefits that can't be overstated.\n\nGenerally, aim for 25-45% of your calories to be carbs (depending on cutting/bulking).\n\n#### Protein\n\nGenerally, you want to keep protein fairly high. Anywhere from .75-1+ gram of protein per lbs of body weight. This can come from any source, as our body will utilize them the same. But some sources are preferred, depending on whether you're cutting or bulking. Ideally, aim for now more than 40-50 grams per meal/protein shake and spread out the consumption through the day.\n\nThe remainder of your calories should be protein.\n\n#### Timing\n\nAs carbs are for energy, many people prefer to have more carbs timed around workouts (and no fats during this period) to help boost performance and recovery. If you're going to eat your carbs (e.g. rice and chicken breast), do so about two hours before working out; otherwise, liquid/quickly consumed carbs are preferred (e.g. orange or apple juice). Again, post-workout, get simple carbs and protein into your system via a shake or meal fairly soon. Save fats for well-before or after workouts.\n\n##Measuring success\n\nFirst and foremost, gym progress should always be factored in first. If your routine says X lift should go up Y amount each week, generally you want to be hitting that to know you're on track. If your lift #s are going up according to your routine, you're doing great! If you aren't, there's a breakdown somewhere and you should ask for guidance if you cannot asses the fail point yourself.\n\nSecondly, the weight scale. You want to make sure your body weight is trending in your goal direction. It's ideal to weigh yourself *the same way* every time.\n\nFor example, I wake up, go to the bathroom, and then weigh myself every day for three weeks and then I average my daily changes over those three weeks. I generally aim to gain .5-.75 lbs per week and lose .75-1 lbs per week. If I'm gaining or losing too much, I adjust my macros ~ 250 calories and measure again for three weeks and so on.\n\nDon't get caught up daily changes; I sometimes vary 3-5 lbs between days! Weigh daily for three weeks and average it out. Don't worry about the daily weight, find an average to determine where the trend is taking you and adjust if needed. This will take the annoying variances out of the picture and let you focus on meaningful change.\n\nYou can also measure your wrists, waist, neck, etc, as well as take photos, but that's more preference and not as commonly suggested.\n\n##Bulking and cutting strategies\n\nI've seen people make amazing progress, both gaining and losing weight, in a variety of ways. Ideally, be healthy. Emphasize fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. But, at the end of the day, many approaches work. You can bulk or cut as a vegan, intermittent fasting ("IF"), KETO, IIFYM, etc. Many approaches work. They are but tools available to you, so find one that best helps you meet your goal. So choose the best "diet" or tool that helps you achieve a goal! If that's keto, great! If that's caveman, awesome. I don't care! Limit your calories in whatever "diet" you choose and you'll see results.\n\nIn my opinion, it's better to make *lifestyle* changes that to follow a diet for a short time. So I don't really like "diets" per se, but more so recommend eating like an adult and limiting calories. But even still, different tactics can help in that goal, and you can deploy as many or as few as you want:\n\n-   Intermittent Fasting ("IF")\n\n-   Tracking macros / IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros)\n\n-   "Banking" calories\n\nI don't buy into the other 'benefits' of IF, but it was a tactic that worked for me. I am a volume eater. I generally eat well, but I like eating *a lot*. So when I'm cutting, my meals were small and sad. The idea behind IF is that you have a short window of time which you eat meals, the rest of the day you fast. Again, all that matters are calories. You can absolutely get fat eating 10k calories in a 5 hour window. So there's no magic in doing this. But for me, doing IF allowed me to have larger, more satiating meals within the "eating window" instead of more, smaller meals.\n\nMacros are discussed above, but the idea behind IIFYM is that you've a set # for each macro and, so long as what you're eating fits neatly into the prescribed macro allotment, go for eating whatever you want! And, again, so long as total calories are low enough for you, you will lose weight. But this is [r/BulkorCut](https://www.reddit.com/r/BulkorCut/), not [r/weightloss](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightloss/). People here are also working out. How well you workout, recover, perform, feel, etc is affected by what you eat. So, sure, add in "fun" foods sometimes. But don't eat like a child simply because it fit your macros. A safe rule of thumb is to eat "cleanly" 80% of the time when bulking, whatever the other 20% of the time. When cutting, I try to eat cleanly 90-95% of the time with fewer treats. What that treat is might change -- some weeks I just want pancakes, other weeks I just want a couple beers. Do what works for you, just do so in controlled quantities.\n\nI liked "banking" calories when I knew I had a special event, date night with the wife, party, or whatever where I'd be consuming extra calories. One way to account for that is to deduct an *additional* amount of calories each day leading up to the event, to then splurge on that event. Example:\n\nLet's say my maintenance is 2,500 calories and I'm eating at a -500 deficit, so I'm eating 2,000 calories daily. I want to take my wife out for our anniversary, so the week leading up to our date night I deduct an additional -250 calories each day and only eat 1,750 calories daily. This gives me 7x250 (=1750) "banked" calories I can add to my 2,000 calories on our anniversary. Now I can have a nice dinner, dessert, a drink or two, all without blowing my diet out of whack!\n\n##Body fat % (BF%) estimates\n\nEstimating ones body fat % is kind of hard. We can't see how much fat is stored internally around organs; some people store more fat over the abs, some more around their love handles (that's me!), and others in their legs/ass. So it's really hard to tell. There are various ways to scan BF%, but most are imprecise with a +/- 20% variance. In my opinion, the only thing they're useful for is estimating BF% *changes*. Let's say it reads 20% for you; in six months, you try again and it says 15%. You probably lost around 5% BF%, but your actual BF% might be 12%-18%. So it's not a particularly accurate reading, but the rate change is a useful gauge.\n\nThe best ways to learn BF% are via:\n\n-   Underwater Weighing (Hydrostatic Weighing) (1-2% variance)\n\n-   DEXA scan (1-2% variance)\n\nEverything else has huge variance and is only useful for measuring rate of change.\n\n##Differences in males and females\n\n-   Basically, [there aren't any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HToXo6gS7-s)\n\n-   It ultimately comes down to goals and therefore what you're going to emphasize/work towards.\n\n##Useful posts/resources\n\n-   [The Absolute Beginner's Guide to the Gym](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cg9c8d/the_absolute_beginners_guide_to_the_gym/)\n\n-   [To Bulk And Cut Or Not To Bulk And Cut](https://bretcontreras.com/to-bulk-and-cut-or-not/)\n\n-   [Here is a credible, no BS approach to getting abs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsph7_-pizw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=146)\n\n##People to follow\n\n-   [pheasyque](https://www.instagram.com/pheasyque/) - excellent diagrams, tutorials, and generally great content on how to lift properly\n\n-   [Stefi Cohen](https://www.instagram.com/steficohen/) - 22 world records, doctorate in physical therapy, gym owner, coach.

The wait-list is over a year long, but it is absolutely worth it, and it was by far the most incredible place I've ever been.\n\nThe whole experience is about 5 days, from a night in Phong Nha village before heading into the jungle, to a night in Hang En - the third largest cave in the world along the way - to 3 days spent inside of Son Doong, before climbing the "Great Wall of Vietnam" to reach the cave's exit.\n\nThe first photo is from Doline 1 (a place where the ceiling has collapsed), and is aptly named "Watch Out for Dinosaurs". The little light is the headlamp of one of our guides, standing atop the "wedding cake" rock formation.\n\nAll-in-all an unbelievable experience, and one of the most unique and breathtakingly beautiful places on Earth - every moment you look around questioning how this place is even real. Highly recommend!!	Hang Son Doong - The Largest Cave on Earth	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o5773n	active	2025-10-14 14:52:31.829033	1	71	16

There's absolutely no point in us all being on here otherwise.\n\nMods have tools to identify these sort of posts, but it's worth reiterating moving into 2025 and with increased AI available in our day-to-day lives that any usage of this sort to make your posts or comments will result in an instant ban. The rules are stated very clearly in the sidebar and are not new.\n\nNone of us joined this community to read regurgitated information from a machine learning model like ChatGPT. AI tools can have their place for travellers sometimes, but outside of the occasional spellcheck or minor translation it should never be the main foundational element for any of your posts on this sub.\n\nWe want responses to be *your* opinions and knowledge. If you're asking a question, we want it to be in *your* voice.\n\nIf you suspect any usage we haven't spotted, report it - we are a group of volunteers on a huge sub and things often slip through the net.\n\nI'm sure all users are on the same page here in terms of not letting AI generated content take over here, so it requires us all to work together.

But Montreal's moody, introspective charm is severely underrated. \n\nSomething I love about Montreal is the mix of big city vibes and Gothic elegance. Everywhere you go there's a feeling of secrets, shadows, hidden stories. Its an old, strange place. I always said that Montreal is the city that reminded me the most of a real life Gotham. \n\n1.
